</h1>
<p>Collectively, the topic of the next two chapters – getting traffic across the public internet and to a listening service is called <em>networking</em>. I’ve broken it down into two chapters. This first chapter will discuss how traffic gets across the public internet and to the server you’ve configured, and in the next chapter, we’ll get into how to configure a private network to make sure your traffic can get where it needs to go.</p>
<p>When you go to a website, that website address starts with <code>https://</code> . We’ll get into the <code>s</code> more later in this chapter. For now, we’ll just focus on the <code>http</code> part. Most modern browsers automatically add the <code>http</code> for you, so you can, for example, type <code>google.com</code>, and your browser will automatically know that you intend to go to <a href="https://www.google.com"><code>https://www.google.com</code></a>.</p>
<p>In this chapter, we’ll pull apart the components of this URL and how you can get one of your very own.</p>

<p>You probably use URLs every day, but let’s take just a minute and break down the components of a URL.</p>
<div class="inline-figure"><img src="images/201-networking/domain.jpeg" width="423"></div>
<p>In this chapter and the next, we’ll get into how each of these components of the URL is created and assigned.</p>
</div>

<span class="header-section-number">4.2</span> Application Layer Protocols: <code>http(s)</code><a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#application-layer-protocols-https"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>The very first part of a URL is the <em>application layer protocol</em>. Application layer protocols define how the server should understand the request that was sent and what are legitimate things to send back. <code>http</code> is the protocol that is used when you go to a webpage on the internet. It defines how to fetch documents across networks – the most common types of documents on the internet being HTML web pages.</p>
<p>There are many other application layer protocols that are used for a variety of purposes. Some you’ll see in this book include <code>SSH</code> for direct server access, <code>(S)FTP</code> for file transfers, <code>LDAP(S)</code> for authentication, and <code>websockets</code> for persistent bi-directional communication – used for interactive webapps created by the Shiny package in R and the Streamlit package in Python.</p>
<div id="what-really-is-http-traffic" class="section level3">
<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">4.2.1</span> What really is <code>http</code> traffic?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#what-really-is-http-traffic"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>The best way to understand http traffic is to inspect it directly. Luckily, you’ve got an easy tool to do that – your browser!</p>
<p>Open a new tab in your browser and open your developer tools. How this works will depend on your browser. In Chrome, you’ll go to View &gt; Developer &gt; Developer Tools and then make sure the Network tab is open.</p>
<p>Now, navigate to a URL in your browser (say google.com).</p>
<p>As you do this, you’ll see the traffic pane fill up. These are the requests and responses going back and forth between your computer and the server.</p>
<p>If you click on any of them, there are a few useful things you can learn.</p>
<div class="inline-figure"><img src="images/paste-4EA67624.png" width="267"></div>
<p>At the top, you can see the timing. This can be helpful in debugging things that take a long time to load. Sometimes it’s helpful to see what stage in the process bogs down.</p>
<p>In this pane, you can inspect the actual content that is going back and forth between your computer and the server you’re accessing. What’s often more useful is being able to inspect the metadata on the requests and responses. Here are a few of the most important fields:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Request Method – getting deep into HTTP request methods is beyond the scope of this book, but there are a variety of different methods you might use to interact with things on the internet. The most common are <code>GET</code> to get a webpage, <code>POST</code> or <code>PUT</code> to change something, and <code>DELETE</code> to delete something.</p></li>
<li><p>Status Code - each HTTP response includes a status code indicating the response category. Some special codes you’ll quickly learn to recognize are below. The one you’ll (hopefully) see the most is 200, which is a successful response.</p></li>
<li><p>Response and Request Headers – headers are metadata included with the request and response. These include things like the type of the request, the type of machine you’re coming from, cookie-setting requests and more. In some cases, these headers include authentication credentials and tokens, and other things you might want to inspect.</p></li>
</ul>

<h4>
<span class="header-section-number">4.2.1.1</span> Special HTTP Codes<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#special-http-codes"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h4>
<p><code>200</code> - everyone’s favorite, a successful response.</p>
<p><code>3xx</code> - Your query was redirected somewhere else.</p>
<p><code>4xx</code> - are errors with the requests. There are a few you’ll probably see particularly often:</p>
<p><code>400</code> - bad request. This isn’t a request the server can understand.</p>
<p><code>401</code> and <code>403</code> - unauthorized or forbidden. Often means required authentication hasn’t been provided.</p>
<p><code>404</code> - Not found. There isn’t any content at the address you’re trying to access.</p>
<p><code>5xx</code> - server-side errors. Some kind of error occurred as the server was trying to process your request.</p>
<p><code>504</code> - gateway timeout. This means that a proxy or gateway between you and the server you’re trying to access timed out before it got a response from the server.</p>

</h2>
<p>We accessed our basic server on the public IP address provided to us by AWS. But that was very likely the first time you’d accessed something on the internet directly using an IP address – for good reason.</p>
<p>IP addresses are how entities are actually identified in computer network, but the IP address <code>143.122.8.32</code> is pretty hard to remember. Even worse, IP addresses generally aren’t permanent – they can change when individual servers are replaced, or if you were to change the server architecture (say by adding and load-balancing a second instance – see chapter XX).</p>
<p>In order to have something human-friendly and permanent, we generally access network resources at a URL, like <code>google.com</code>, rather than an IP address.</p>
<div id="an-aside-about-ip-addresses" class="section level3">
<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">4.3.1</span> An aside about IP addresses…<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#an-aside-about-ip-addresses"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>As you start working more intimately with servers, you’ll spend more time staring at IP addresses, so it’s worth taking a moment to talk about how to recognize them.</p>
<p>The IP addresses so far in this book are IPv4 addresses. They’re four blocks of 8-bit fields (integers up to 256), so they look like <code>0.0.0.0</code> to <code>255.255.255.255</code>. If you do the math, you’ll realize there are <em>“only”</em> a little more than 4 billion of these, which it turns out is not enough and we’re running out.</p>
<p>In the last few years, adoption of the new standard, IPv6, has started. IPv6 addresses are eight blocks of hexadecimal (<code>0-9</code> + <code>a-f</code>) digits separated by colons, with certain rules that allow them to be shortened, so <code>4b01:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334</code> or <code>3da4:66a::1</code> are both examples of valid IPv6 addresses.</p>
<p>IPv6 will coexist with IPv4 for a few decades, and we’ll eventually switch entirely to IPv6. There’s no worry about running out of IPv6 addresses any time soon, because the total number of IPv6 addresses is a number 39 digits long.</p>
<p>There is one IP address you may frequently see, which is <code>127.0.0.1</code> or <code>localhost</code> – sometimes called the loopback address. When you see this, it means that the traffic is being directed back to the same machine where it’s originating. This is sometimes useful for testing, or to reach another service on the same machine.</p>
</div>
<div id="getting-a-domain" class="section level3">
<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">4.3.2</span> Getting a Domain<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#getting-a-domain"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>The first step to getting a real URL is buying a domain from a <em>domain name registrar</em>. There are many different registrars that will sell you domain names on the internet. In general, the process of buying one is super easy. Usually, you’ll just need to search for the domain you want, say you want it, and pull out a credit card.</p>
<p>The cost of a domain name varies widely. Buying a meaningless domain in a less popular top-level domain, say <code>ladskfmlsdf.me</code> can cost as little as $3 per year. On the other hand, buying a <code>.com</code> domain that’s a real word or phrase can be a few thousand dollars.</p>
<p>Once you’ve got an IP address and a domain, you’ve got to connect the two.</p>
<p>This is where the <strong>domain name system (DNS)</strong> comes in. DNS is the decentralized internet phonebook that translates back and forth between URLs and IP addresses. There are many layers of DNS servers, so pointing your browser at <code>example.com</code> starts with a query to a DNS server asking, “Where is the DNS server for <code>.com</code> websites?”</p>
<p>Eventually, a query for your website will lead to the DNS server of your domain name registrar. You’ll have to configure your domain name registrar to send traffic on to the right place.</p>
<p>Configuration of DNS is done by way of <em>records</em>, of which there are a menagerie of types you <em>can</em> configure. Luckily, most simple configurations only need <em>CNAME</em> and <em>A</em> records.</p>
<p>Here’s an imaginary DNS record table for the domain <code>example.com</code>:</p>
<div class="inline-table"><table class="table table-sm">
<thead><tr class="header">
<th>Path/Host</th>
<th>Type</th>
<th>Target</th>
</tr></thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><code>@</code></td>
<td>A</td>
<td><code>143.122.8.32</code></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><code>www</code></td>
<td>CNAME</td>
<td>example.com</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><code>*</code></td>
<td>A</td>
<td><code>143.122.8.33</code></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table></div>
<p>Let’s go through how to read this table.</p>
<p>Since we’re configuring <code>example.com</code>, the paths/hosts in this table are relative to <code>example.com</code>.</p>
<p>In the first row we’re configuring an A record to go to the target IP address. <em>A records</em> (or their IPv6 cousin <em>AAAA records</em>) map a domain to an actual IP address. The path <code>@</code> is a special symbol meaning exact match. So by this configuration, any traffic to <code>example.com</code> will be passed straight through to the specified IP address.</p>
<p>The second row deals with traffic to the <code>www</code> subdomain. <em>CNAME records</em> alias sub-domains. They’re most frequently used to map sub-domains to the main domain. Since this is a <code>CNAME</code> record for example.com, this record indicates that traffic to www.example.com should be treated exactly like traffic to <code>example.com</code>. Some domain providers do automatic redirection of <code>www</code> traffic, and so this row may not be necessary in some configurations.</p>
<p>The last record uses the wildcard symbol <code>*</code> to send all subdomain traffic that’s not already spoken for – say <code>blog.example.com</code> or <code>info.example.com</code> directly to the IP address specified.</p>
<p>So what happens is that your query goes through several layers of public DNS servers to get to the DNS entry for your domain name registrar. In many cases, you’ll directly configure your domain name registrar to point to your website or server – but you also can configure the domain name registrar to point at another set of DNS servers you actually control with an <em>NS record</em>.</p>
<p>If you’re setting up your own server, this probably isn’t the case, but some large enterprises do run their own private DNS servers.</p>
<aside><p>You should always configure your domain provider as narrowly as possible – and you should configure your website or server <em>first</em>.</p>
<p>#TODO: why?</p>

<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">4.3.3</span> Learning to Hate DNS<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#learning-to-hate-dns"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>As you get deeper into using servers, you will learn to hate DNS with a fiery passion. While it’s necessary so we’re not running around trying to remember incomprehensible IP addresses, it’s also very hard to debug as a server admin.</p>
<p>Let’s say I’ve got the public domain <code>example.com</code>, and I’m taking down the server and putting up a new one. I’ve got to alter the public DNS record so that everyone going to <code>example.com</code> gets routed to the new IP address, and not the old one.</p>
<p>The thing that makes it particularly challenging is that the DNS system is decentralized. There are thousands of public DNS servers that a request could get routed to, and many of them may need updating.</p>
<p>Obviously, this is a difficult problem to solve, and it can take up to 24 hours for DNS changes to propagate across the network. So making changes to DNS records and checking if they’ve worked is kinda a guessing game of whether enough time has passed that you can conclude that your change didn’t work right, or if you should just wait longer.</p>
<p>To add an additional layer of complexity, DNS lookups are slow, so your browser caches the results of DNS lookups it has done before. That means that it’s possible you’ll still get an old website even once the public DNS record has been updated. If a website has ever not worked for you and then worked when you tried a private browser, DNS caching is likely the culprit. Using a private browsing window sidesteps your main DNS cache and forces lookups to happen afresh.</p>

</h2>
<p>When you go to a website on the internet, you’ll see the URL prefixed by the <code>https</code> (though it’s sometimes hidden by your browser because it’s assumed). <code>https</code> is actually a mashup that is short for <code>http</code> with secure sockets layer (SSL).</p>
<p>These days, almost everyone actually uses the successor to SSL, transport layer security (TLS). However, because the experience of configuring TLS is identical to SSL, admins usually just talk about configuring SSL even when they mean TLS.</p>
<p>These days, almost every bit of internet traffic is actually <code>https</code> traffic. You will occasionally see <code>http</code> traffic inside private networks where encryption might not be as important – but more and more organizations are requiring end-to-end use of SSL.</p>
<p>Securing your website or server using SSL/TLS is one of the most basic things you can do to make sure your website traffic is safe. You should always configure <code>https</code> – full stop.</p>
<p>SSL/TLS security is accomplished by configuring your site or server to use a SSL certificate (often abbreviated to cert). We’ll go through the details of how to get and configure an SSL certificate in this chapter – but first a little background on how SSL/TLS works.</p>
<div id="how-ssltls-enhances-security" class="section level3">
<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">4.4.1</span> How SSL/TLS Enhances Security<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#how-ssltls-enhances-security"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>SSL accomplishes two things for you – identity validation and traffic encryption.</p>
<p>When you go to a website, SSL/TLS is the technology that verifies that you’re actually reaching the website you think you’re reaching. This prevents something called a man-in-the-middle attack where a malicious actor manages to get in between the server and the client of network traffic. So, for example, you might think you’re putting your bank login information into your normal bank website, but there’s a hacker sitting in the middle, reading all of the traffic back and forth.</p>
<p>[TODO: Image of man-in-the-middle]</p>
<p>You can see this in action in your web browser. When you go to a website protected by <code>https</code>, you’ll see a little lock icon to the left of the URL. That means that this website’s SSL certificate matches the website and therefore your computer can verify you’re actually at the website you mean to be at.</p>
<p>But how does your computer know what a valid SSL certificate is? Your computer has a list of trusted Certificate Authorities (CAs) who create, sell, and validate SSL/TLS certificates. So when you navigate to a website, the website sends back a digital signature. Your computer checks the signature against the indicated CA to verify that it was issued to the site in question.</p>
<p>[TODO: image of SSL validation]</p>
<p>The second type of scary scenario SSL prevents is a snooping/sniffing attack. Even if you’re getting to the right place, your traffic travels through many different channels along the way – routers, network switches, and more. This means that someone could theoretically look at all your traffic along the way to its meaningful destination.</p>
<p>When your computer gets back the digital signature to verify the site’s identity, it also prompts an exchange of encryption keys. These keys are used to encrypt traffic back and forth between you and the server so anyone snooping on your message will just see garbled nonsense and not your actual content. You can think of the SSL/TLS encryption as the equivalent of writing a message on a note inside an envelope, rather than on a postcard anyone could read along the way.</p>

</h3>
<p>In order to configure your site or server with SSL, there are three steps you’ll want to take: getting an SSL certificate, putting the certificate on the server, and making sure the server <em>only</em> accepts <code>https</code> traffic.</p>
<p>You can either buy an SSL certificate or make one yourself, using what’s called a <em>self-signed cert</em>.</p>
<p>There are a variety of places you can buy an SSL/TLS certificate, in many cases, your domain name registrar can issue you one when you buy your domain.</p>
<p>When you create or buy your cert, you’ll have to choose the scope. A basic SSL certificate covers just the domain itself, formally known as a fully qualified domain name (FQDN). So if you get a basic SSL certificate for <code>www.example.com</code>, <code>www.blog.example.com</code> will not be covered. You can get a <em>wildcard certificate</em> that would cover every subdomain of <code>*.example.com</code>.</p>
<aside><p>Note that basic SSL/TLS certification only validates that when you type <code>example.com</code> in your browser, that you’ve gotten the real <code>example.com</code>. It doesn’t in any way validate who owns <code>example.com</code>, whether they’re reputable, or whether you should trust them.</p>
<p>There are higher levels of SSL certification that do validate that, for example, the company that owns <code>google.com</code> is actually the company Google.</p>
</aside><p>But sometimes it’s not feasible to buy certificates. While a basic SSL certificate for a single domain can cost $10 per year or less, wildcard certificates will all the bells and whistles can cost thousands per year. This can get particularly expensive if you’ve got a lot of domains for some reason.</p>
<p>Moreover, there are times when you <em>can’t</em> buy a certificate. If you’re encrypting traffic inside a private network, you will need certificates for hosts or IP addresses that are only valid inside the private network, so there’s no public CA to validate them.</p>
<p>There are two potential avenues to follow. In some cases, like inside a private network, you want SSL/TLS for the encryption, but don’t really care about the identity validation part. In this case, it’s usually possible to skip that identity validation part and automatically trust the certificate for encryption purposes.</p>
<p>It’s also possible to create your own private CA, which would verify all your SSL certificates. This is pretty common in large organizations. At some point, every server and laptop needs to have the private CA added to its set of trusted certificate validators.</p>
<p>A warning: it is deceptively easy to generate and configure a self-signed SSL certificate. It’s usually just a few lines of shell commands to create a certificate, and adding the certificate to your server or website is usually just a copy/paste affair.</p>
<p>However, it’s pretty common to run into problems with self-signed certs or private CAs. Making sure the certificate chain is correct, or running into a piece of software that doesn’t ignore the identity validation piece right is pretty common. This shouldn’t dissuade you from using SSL/TLS. It’s an essential, and basic, component of any security plan – but using a self-signed cert probably isn’t as easy as it seems.</p>
<p>When you configure your site or server, there will likely be an option to redirect all <code>http</code> traffic to <code>https</code> traffic. If your server or site is open to the internet, you should set this option.</p>
