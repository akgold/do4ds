|--------------------|---------|----------------|-----------------|-----------|
| I'm trying to take my/our DS practices + procedures to the next level. I need a **framework** for what I should do.                                                        | Unclear    | I know we need to be *better*, but I don't really know what that means.                             | DO4DS gives me a framework + tools for thinking about production data science.                                                  | Clear       |
| I don't know how to communicate with the IT/Admins who manage our data science environment. I need **advice**.                                                             | Confused   | I don't know what matters to IT/Admins or the words they use. Are they just bamboozling me?         | DO4DS helps me understand the concerns of an IT/Admin and gives me the vocabulary to speak with them.                           | DS-Focused  |
| I'm suddenly have to manage a data science environment as a data scientist. I need to know **where to start** with this IT/Admin stuff.                                    | Alone      | I have no mental models for how IT/Admin stuff works. Can someone help me understand?               | DO4DS gives me step-by-step instructions for getting started.                                                                   | Actionable  |
| I'm administering a data science environment, but I'm way over my head. I need some **reassurance** that I'm not accidentally laying landmines I'm going to step on later. | Scared     | I think I've figured it out, but I'm self-taught and don't know if I've missed something important. | DO4DS gives me a mental model for dangers and ways to limit them. I might not have it perfect now, but I understand the issues. | Forewarned  |
