# Enterprise Networking {#sec-ent-networks}

Though it may sound hyperbolic, enterprise networks are constantly under
siege. The public internet is swirling with people and bots trying to
access private environments to exfiltrate data or co-opt free
computational resources.

Networking is the outermost layer of security for a private computing
environment. It's like the outer wall of a gated community for all the
servers the IT/Admin group maintains.

In this chapter, you'll learn about how an enterprise IT/Admin thinks
about configuring networking, as well as some of the issues that come up
when trying to do data science inside a locked-down enterprise
environment.

## Enterprise networks are private

An enterprise network houses dozens or hundreds of servers, each with
its own connection requirements. Some are accessible to the outside,
while others are only accessible to other servers inside the network.

For that reason, the servers controlled by an enterprise live inside one
or more *private networks*. The good news is that private networks look
like public ones, which you learned about in [Chapter @sec-networking].
Every host in a private network has an IP Address. It's just a private
IP Address handed out by the router that governs the network and is
valid only inside the private network. And, like you can get a domain
for a human-friendly way to address a server on a public network, many
private networks use private *hostnames* to have human-friendly ways to
talk about servers.

## Where's My Private Network?

In AWS, every server lives inside a private network called a *virtual
private cloud* (VPC). When we set up our data science workbench
throughout Part II, we ignored the VPC and assigned the instance a public
IP Address -- which explains why this is the first time you've heard
about it.

In an enterprise context, this kind of configuration would be a no-go.
:::

With so many services running inside a network, connection requirements
can get byzantine. For example, you probably want to set up a data
science workbench and a data science deployment platform.

You'll need those services to:

-   Be reachable from users' laptops.

-   Reach one or more databases that are only accessible from inside the
    private network and may also connect to data sources.

-   Access a package repository.

And, to comply with the principle of least privilege, you don't want any
of these servers to be more available than needed. Providing precisely
the right level of networking access isn't a trivial undertaking.

Those are just the servers for actually doing work. Enterprise networks
also include various devices that control the network traffic itself.
When you're working in a data science environment and run into trouble,
you should start by asking whether the issue could be with network
traffic struggling to get into, out of, or across the private network.

## The shape of an enterprise network

When you access something important inside a private network, the IP
Address is rarely the server doing the work. Instead, it's usually the
address of a *proxy server* or *proxy*, an entire server that exists
just to run proxy software that routes traffic around the network.

Routing all traffic through the proxy ensures that the work servers only
get traffic from other servers that the organization controls,
decreasing the number of attack vectors to the work servers. Proxy
servers may also do other tasks like terminate SSL or authentication.

## VPN vs. VPC?

You may have to log in to a *Virtual Private Network* (VPN) for work or
school. Where a VPC is a private network inside a cloud environment, a
VPN is a private network for remote access to a shared network. You
generally don't directly log in to an enterprise VPC (or on-prem private
network), but you might log in to an adjacent VPN ensuring that anyone
who accesses the network is coming from an authenticated machine.

Enterprise networks are almost always subdivided into *subnets*, which
are logically separate partitions of the private
network.[^3-1-ent-networks-1] In most cases, the private network is
divided between the *public subnet* or *demilitarized zone* (DMZ) where
the proxies live, and the *private subnet* where all the important
servers live.[^3-1-ent-networks-2]

[^3-1-ent-networks-1]: Subnets are defined as a range of IP Addresses by
    something called a *CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) block*. Each CIDR block is defined by a starting address and a suffix that
    indicates the size of the range. For example, the $10.33.0.0/26$
    CIDR block is the 64 addresses from $10.33.0.0$ to $10.33.0.63$. Each CIDR number is half the size of the prior block, so the
    $10.33.0.0/26$ CIDR can be split into the $10.33.0.0/27$ block of 32
    addresses from $10.33.0.0$ to $10.33.0.31$ and the $10.33.0.32/27$
    block for $10.33.0.32$ through $10.33.0.63$. Don't try to remember this. There are online CIDR block calculators
    if you ever need to create them.

[^3-1-ent-networks-2]: The public subnet usually hosts at least two
    proxies -- one to handle regular HTTP(S) traffic and one just to
    route \index{SSH}SSH traffic to hosts in the private network. The
    \index{SSH}SSH proxy is often called a *bastion host* or *jump box*. There are also network infrastructure devices to translate public
    and private IP Addresses back and forth that go alongside the
    proxies. Private subnets have a device that only allows outbound
    traffic called a *NAT Gateway* (Network Address Translation Gateway) by AWS.
    Public subnets have a two-way device called an *Internet Gateway* by
    AWS. It's also very common to have four subnets and duplicate the
    public/private subnet configuration across two availability zones to
    be resilient to failures in one availability zone.

![](images/subnets.png){.lightbox
fig-alt="A private network where people come to public subnet with HTTP proxy and Bastion Host. Access to Work Nodes in Private Subnet is only from Public Subnet."}

Aside from the security benefits, putting the important servers in the
private subnet is also more convenient because the IT/Admins can use
private hostnames and IP Addresses without worrying about uniqueness on
the public internet. For example, they could use the hostname
$\text{google.com}$ for a server because it only needs to be valid
inside the private network. But, that's confusing and I wouldn't
recommend it.

## Networking pain follows proxies

The most straightforward networking issue is that a connection doesn't
exist where one is needed. This is usually clear when using tools like
`ping` and `curl` and can be solved by working with your IT/Admin team.

Difficulties tend to be more subtle when proxies are involved and
enterprise networks feature proxies all over the place. Much like the
watertight bulkheads between every room on a naval ship, proxies show up
between any two parts of the network that you might want to seal off at
some point. And where a proxy exists, it can cause you trouble.

In fact, two different proxies might mess with any given leg of the
journey. There could be a proxy that handles the traffic as it leaves
one server (*outbound*) as well as one that intercepts traffic arriving
at the destination (*inbound*).

::: callout-note
## Inbound and Outbound Proxies

Inbound and outbound are terms I've chosen, not industry standard terminology.

Traditionally, proxies are classified as either *reverse* or *forward*. The classification is done as if
you're a host inside the private network, with inbound proxies called
reverse and outbound ones called forward. I found that nearly impossible
to remember and started using inbound and outbound. I find it much
easier to remember, and IT/Admins always understand what I mean.
:::

![](images/proxy-dir.png){.lightbox
fig-alt="Inbound/Reverse proxies handle traffic into the private network. Outbound/Forward proxies handle traffic going out."}

The first step in debugging networking issues is to ask whether one or
more proxies might be in the middle. You can jumpstart that discussion
by clearly describing where the traffic originates, where it's going,
the protocol it's using, and the port it's targeting.

People often get tripped up on where the traffic originates and
terminates, especially when using their laptop to access a server. When
you're accessing a data science project running on a server, the only
inbound traffic to the private network is the connection from your
laptop to the server. Code that runs on the server can only generate
outbound traffic. So, nearly all the traffic you care about is outbound,
including package installation, making \index{API}API calls in your code
with `{requests}` or `{httr2}`, connecting to a \index{Git}Git repo, or
connecting to data sources.

### Issues with Inbound Proxies

Almost all private networks feature inbound proxies that handle traffic
coming in from the internet. This can cause problems in a data science
environment if everything isn't configured correctly.

::: callout-note
### What Ports Do I Need?

One of the first questions IT/Admins ask is what ports must be open in
the proxy.

Database traffic often runs using non-HTTP traffic to special ports. For
example, Postgres runs on port $5432$. However, your database traffic
should probably all occur inside the private network so this won't be an
issue.

Almost other traffic, including package downloads, is standard HTTP(S)
traffic, so it can happily run over $80$ or $443$.
:::

Inbound redirection issues can be hairy to debug. Very often, these
issues arise because the application you're using (say,
\index{JupyterHub}JupyterHub or \index{RStudio}RStudio) expects to be
able to redirect you back to itself. If the proxy isn't configured
correctly, the service will start and run just fine, but certain user
interactions won't work the way you expect.[^3-1-ent-networks-3] This
will likely surface upon starting new sessions or launching something
(like an app or doc) inside the platform. Your application should have
an admin guide with directions on hosting it behind a proxy. Confirm
with your admin that those steps have been followed precisely.

[^3-1-ent-networks-3]: For example, remember those headers we had to add
    to traffic to \index{RStudio}RStudio Server in [Chapter
    @sec-networking] and [Chapter @sec-ssl] so it knew it was on a
    subpath and on HTTPS. This can be particularly gnarly if your proxy also does
    authentication. If your proxy expects that every request has
    credentials attached, but your application doesn't realize it has to
    go through the proxy, weird behavior can ensue when your application
    calls itself via HTTP.

Proxies also often impose file size limits and/or session duration
timeouts. If weird things happen during file uploads or downloads, or
sessions end unexpectedly, start by checking on the inbound proxy
settings.

Some data science app frameworks, including \index{Shiny}Shiny and
\index{Streamlit}Streamlit, use a technology called *websockets* to maintain the
connection between the user and the app session. Most modern proxies
support websockets, but since some older on-prem proxies don't, you may
have to figure out a workaround if you can't get websockets enabled on
your proxy.

## Airgapping with outbound proxies

Unlike inbound proxies, which appear in virtually every enterprise
private network, outbound proxies are only used when there is a need to
restrict traffic from leaving the private network. This can be necessary
to avoid data exfiltration or to ensure that users only acquire
resources that have been explicitly allowed into the environment.

Environments with limited outbound access are called *offline* or *airgapped*. The term airgap is from a time when network connections required physical wires, and referred to literally separating a machine or private network from the internet with a gap of air. These days, truly airgapped networks are very rare
and airgapping is usually accomplished by routing outbound traffic to
an outbound proxy that disallows (nearly) all connections.

The biggest issue in an airgapped environment is that you can't access
anything outside the private network, including public repositories of Python
and R packages. You need to make sure your IT/Admin understands that
you cannot do your job without a way to use packages. There's more
on managing packages in an airgapped environment in [Chapter
@sec-ent-pm].

Your IT/Admin must also determine how to manage
\index{operating system}operating system updates, system library
installations, and licensing of any paid software inside the
environment.[^3-1-ent-networks-4] They likely already have solutions
that include a data transfer system, internal repositories, and/or
temporarily opening the firewall.

[^3-1-ent-networks-4]: In online neworks, licenses are often applied by
    reaching out to a license server owned by the software vendor.

## Comprehension questions

1.  What is the advantage of adopting a more complex networking setup
    over a server deployed directly on the internet? Are there
    advantages other than security?
2.  Draw a mental map with the following entities: inbound traffic,
    outbound traffic, proxy, private subnet, public subnet, VPC.
3.  Let's say you've got a private VPC that hosts an instance of
    \index{RStudio}RStudio Server, \index{JupyterHub}JupyterHub, and
    \index{Shiny}Shiny Server with an app deployed. Here are a few
    examples of traffic. Are they outbound, inbound, or within the
    network?
    a.  Someone connecting to and starting a session on
        \index{RStudio}RStudio Server.
