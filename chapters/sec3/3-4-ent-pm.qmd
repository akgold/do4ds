# Package Management in the Enterprise {#sec-ent-pm}

The most obvious day-to-day difference for a data scientist at an
enterprise versus a smaller organization is how they manage open-source
Python and R packages.

Many small organizations have a lassiez-faire attitude towards packages.
You install what you need when you need from where you need. You have
free reign to install packages from PyPI, Conda Forge, CRAN,
BioConductor, GitHub, and wherever else you might want. That is unlikely
to be true in an enterprise context.

As a data scientist, you understand in your bones how badly you need
access to numerous open-source libraries and packages to get anything
done. But the IT/Admins at your organization probably don't have that
same understanding, and an enterprise may have organizational rules that
govern how software comes into their environments.

This chapter will help you understand the concerns IT/Admins have around
packages to help you better collaborate with them.

## Ensuring packages are safe

The biggest concern most IT/Admins have about packages is that they might be unsafe. Unsafe packages might introduce exploitable bugs in your code to allow outside actors to get in or may themselves be trojan horses that exfiltrate data.

Some of these security concerns can be ameliorated because most data
science projects are run entirely inside a private environment. For
example, there are many security concerns with running Javascript on
public websites that are sharply reduced when the only people who can
access your application are already staff at your organization. Similarly, a package that maliciously grabs data from your system and exports it will be rendered ineffective in an airgapped environment.

Depending on your industry, IT/Admins may also take some responsibility for creating "validated" environments full of only packages that are known to create good results. This is particularly common in industries that have longstanding statistical practices, like Pharma. In other cases, organizations will only want to use packages that are known to be well-maintained and will be in the future.

A basic, but effective, form of package security is to limit allowed
packages to popular packages, packages from known organizations/authors,
or packages that outside groups have validated to be safe.

Increasingly, there are industry groups that are validating that certain
packages have met quality and security standards and that anyone in the
industry should feel comfortable using them. For example, the [R
Validation Hub](https://www.pharmar.org/) is a pharmaceutical industry
group that is working to create lists of packages that are broadly
agreed to meet certain quality standards. There are also paid products
that may serve this validation function.

Other organizzations may want to check that incoming
packages don't contain known security vulnerabilities.

Every day, security vulnerabilities in software are identified and
publicized. These vulnerabilities are maintained in the *CVE* (*Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures*) system. Each CVE is assigned an
identifier and a severity score that ranges from `None` to `Critical`.

Very often, companies have policies that disallow the usage of software
with too many vulnerabilities. These policies often completely ban
software with `Critical` CVEs and only temporarily allow software with a
few `High` CVEs.

Some organizations try to ensure the security of incoming packages via a
*code scanner*. A code scanner is a piece of software that scans all
incoming code and detects potential security risks -- like usage of
insecure encryption libraries, calls to external web services, or places
where it accesses a database.

These are almost always paid tools. It is my personal opinion that the
creators of these tools often overstate the potential benefits and that
a lot of code scanning is security theater. Unfortunately, that doesn't
change the reality that getting open-source packages into your
environment may require them going through a code scanner.

The sophistication of these tools is roughly in proportion to how
popular the language is. So Javascript, which is both extremely popular
and also makes up most public websites, has reasonably well-developed
software scanning. Python, which is very popular, but is only rarely on
the front end of websites has fewer scanners, and R, which is far less
popular and is never in a website front end has none as far as I'm
aware.

## Open source licensing issues

In addition to security issues, some organizations are concerned about
the legal implications of using free and open-source software (FOSS) in
their environment. These organizations, most often organizations that
themselves write software, want to limit the use of certain types of
licenses inside their environment.

::: callout-note
I am not a lawyer and this is not legal advice, but hopefully this is
helpful context on the legal issues around FOSS software.
:::

When someone releases software, they can choose a *license*, which isa
legal document explaining what consumers are allowed to do with that
software.

The type of license you're probably most familiar with is a copyright. A
copyright gives the owner exclusivity to distribute the software and
charge for it. For example, if you buy a copy of Microsoft Word, you
have a limited license to use the software, but you're not allowed to
inspect the source code of Microsoft Word and you're not allowed to
share the software.

In 1985, the Free Software Foundation (FSF) was created to support the
creation of free software. They wanted to facilitate using, reusing, and
sharing software. In particular, the FSF supported four freedoms for
software:[^3-4-ent-pm-1]

[^3-4-ent-pm-1]: They're numbered 1-4 here for clarity in writing, but
    like many computer science topics, the numbering actually starts at
    0.

1.  Run the program however you wish for any purpose.
2.  Study the source code of the program and change it as you wish.
3.  Redistribute the software as you wish to others.
4.  Distribute copies of the software once you've made changes so
    everyone can benefit.

Now, you could just do this without applying a license to your software.
But from a lawyer's perspective, that's dangerous and unsustainable.
Creating and applying FOSS licenses to software made it something that
was enforceable.

::: callout-note
## What does "free" mean?

It's expensive to create and maintain FOSS. For that reason, the *free*
in FOSS is about *freedom*, not about zero cost. As a common saying goes
-- it means free as in free speech, not free as in free beer.

There are many different flavors of open-source licenses. All of them
I'm aware of, even the
[anti-capitalist](https://anticapitalist.software/) one, allow you to
charge for software.

Organizations have attempted to support FOSS with a variety of different
business models to varying degrees of success. These models include
donations, paid features or products, advertising or integrations, and
paid support, services, or hosting.
:::

There isn't just one FOSS license, instead there are dozens that fall
into two categories. *Permissive* licenses allow you to do essentially
whatever you want with the FOSS software. For example, the permissive
MIT license allows you to, "use, copy, modify, merge, publish,
distribute, sublicense, and/or sell" MIT-licensed software without
attribution. Most organizations have basically no concerns about using
software with a permissive open-source license.

The bigger concern is using software that has a *copyleft* or *viral*
license. Software licensed under a copyleft regime requires that any
derivative works are themselves released under a similar license. The
idea is that open-source software should beget more open-source software
and not silently be used by big companies to make megabucks.

The concern enterprises have with copyleft licenses is that they might
propagate into the private work you are doing inside your company. This
concern is especially keen at organizations that themselves sell
proprietary software. For example, what if a court were to rule that
Apple or Google had to suddenly open-source all their software because
of the use of copyleft licenses by developers there?

Much of the concern centers around what it means for a piece of software
to be a derivative work of another. Most people agree that artifacts
created with copyleft-licensed software, like your plots, reports, and
apps, are not themselves derivative works. But the treatment of software
that incorporates copyleft-licensed software is murky. The reality is
that there have been basically no court cases on this topic and nobody
knows how it would shake out if it did get to court, so some
organizations err on the side of caution.

These concerns are somewhat less for Python than for R. Python is
released under a permissive Python Software Foundation (PSF) license and
Jupyter Notebook under a permissive modified BSD. R is released under
the copyleft GPL license and RStudio under a copyleft AGPL.

However, every single package author can choose a license for
themselves. In an enterprise context, these discussions tend to focus on
knowing -- and potentially blocking -- the use of packages under
copyleft licenses inside the enterprise. Some package repository
software surfaces the license type of individual packages to help
organizations make their own decisions.

## Controlling package flows

Whether your organization is trying to limit CVE exposure, run a code scanner, limit copyleft exposure, or stick to a known list of good packages, they need a way to actually restrict the packages that are
available inside the environment.

If you've giving someone access to Python or R, it's not possible to
just remove their ability to run `pip install` or `install.packages`.
That's one reason why many enterprise environments are airgapped -- it's
the only way to ensure data scientists can't install packages from
outside the environment.

Most IT/Admins understand that airgapping is the best way to stop
unauthorized package installs. The next bit -- that they need to provide
you some way to install packges -- is the part that may require some
convincing.

In order to allow packages to be installed in their environments, many
enterprises run *package repository software* inside their firewall.
Common package repositories include Jfrog Artifactory, Sonatype Nexus,
Anaconda Business, and Posit Package Manager.

Artifactory and Nexus are generalized library and package management
solutions for all sorts of software, while Anaconda and Posit Package
Manager are more narrowly tailored for data science use cases. If
possible, I'd try working with your IT/Admins to get a data science
focused repository software. Often these repositories can run alongside
general-purpose repositories if you already have them.

Depending on the repository software you use, it may connect to an
outside sync service or support manual file transfers for package
updates. In many cases, IT/Admins are comfortable having narrow
exceptions so the package repository can download packages, but no one
in the data science environment can reach the internet.

width="600"}

This tends to work best when the IT/Admin is the one who controls which
packages are allowed into the repository and when. Then you, as the data
scientist, have the freedom to install those packages into any
individual project and manage them there using environment as code
tooling, as discussed in [Chapter @sec-env-as-code].
