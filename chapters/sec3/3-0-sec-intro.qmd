# Enterprise-grade data science {#sec-3-intro}

Most data scientists aren't allowed to just stand up servers at their
whim. Many organizations operate at a scale or with security and process
requirements that mean that professional IT/Admins manage their servers.

I'm going to refer to these larger, more mature organizations as
*enterprise*. If you work at an enterprise, and need a server, your
IT/Admins can be great partners or infuriating gatekeepers.

When the partnership works well, having professional IT/Admins is a
great collaboration. You get to focus on doing data science, while the
IT/Admin creates a great environment where you can work. But even in the
best cases, you're working with people on a different team, with a
different understanding of what the work is, and different concerns and
priorities.

This section of the book is designed to help you understand the point of
view of IT/Admins in an enterprise. I hope by the end of the next few
chapters, you understand why they're not just letting you set up
servers, understand the tools they have at their disposal, and are
prepared to clearly articulate what you need from them.

## Creating a DevOps culture

As a data scientist, your primary concern about your data science
environment is that it's useful. You want the latest versions of Python
or R, abundant access to packages, and data right at your fingertips.

Great IT/Admin teams also care about the usefulness of the system to
users (that's you), but it's usually a distant third to their primary
concerns of security and stability. And there's a benefit to you from
that. You may be primarily focused on getting stuff done
minute-to-minute, but an insecure or unstable data science platform is
not useful.

There's a reason why these concerns primarily arise in an enterprise
context. If you're a team of three data scientists who sit next to each
other, someone crashing your workbench server is probably a fun chance
to drink some coffee and learn something new about how servers work.

But if you're working on an enterprise-grade data science workbench,
it's really frustrating if someone three teams over can disturb your
work. And you definitely don't want to work in an environment where you
constantly have to be thinking about security risks.

Balancing security, stability, and usefulness is always about tradeoffs.
After all, the most secure and stable computing environment is the one
that doesn't exist at all. Organizations that do DevOps right embrace
this tension and are constantly figuring out the right stance for the
organization as a whole.

It is an unfortunate truth that many IT/Admin organizations don't act as
partners. They act as gatekeepers to the resources you need to do your
job, which can be incredibly frustrating. That means you'll have to
figure out how to communicate with those teams, understand what matters
to them, help them understand what matters to you, and reach minimally
acceptable organizational outcomes.

## A hierarchy of IT/Admin concerns

The primary concerns of IT/Admins are security and stability. A system
that is secure and stable gives valid users access to the systems they
need to get work done and doesn't give access to people who shouldn't
have access. If you understand and communicate with IT/Admins about the
risks they perceive, it can help generate buy-in from them that you're
taking their concerns seriously.

The worst outcome for a supposedly secure data science platform would be
for an unauthorized person to gain access to and steal data. In the most
extreme form, this is someone completely outside the organization
(*outsider threat*). But it also could be someone inside the
organization who is disgruntled, seeking personal gain, or just careless
(*insider threat*). A related risk is someone hijacking systems that
don't contain sensitive data and appropriating your organization's
computational resources for nefarious ends like crypto mining or virtual
DDOS attacks on Turkish banks.[^3-0-sec-intro-1]

[^3-0-sec-intro-1]: Yes, both things I've actually seen happen.

Somewhat less concerning, but still the stuff of IT/Admin nightmares is
platform instability that results in the erasure of important data,
called *data loss*. And even if data isn't permanently lost, instability
that results in lost time for platform users is also bad.

Depending on the context, IT/Admins may have some stake in ensuring that
they don't allow in software that results in bad or incorrect work. And
last, way down the list, is that the users don't have a bad experience
using the environment.

## Enterprise tools and techniques

Conceptually, enterprise IT/Admins are always trying to implement
*security in layers*. This means that an application or server has
multiple different kinds of security in place, making it harder for an
accident or breach to occur.

At every layer, sophisticated organizations are trying to implement the
*principle of least privilege*. The idea is that they are trying to keep
systems safe and stable by giving people the permissions they need to
get their work done -- and no more. For example, while you might want to
have root access on your data science workbench, you are almost
certainly not getting it if you work in an enterprise context, because
you don't really need it.

There is no one-size-fits-all (or even most) way to implement these
things. Depending on the relative value of keeping information tightly
controlled or more broadly available at your organization, you may have
different solutions in place.

## Build or Buy?

One big question any enterprise IT/Admin faces when creating a data
science environment is whether to buy something or build it. Some
IT/Admin organizations prefer to build data science platforms straight
from open-source tools like JupyterHub and RStudio Server on a handful
of VMs or in Kubernetes. Others prefer to buy a whole solution from a
vendor.

In my experience, enterprises with extraordinarily competent IT/Admin
teams can be better off building, but they are extremely rare. Most
organizations that try to build their own environments from scratch end
up with major pain points that would be solved by purchasing a solution.

I am obviously biased on this front, working for a company that sells
this software, but I have seen many organizations decide to build
something and decline to buy Posit's Pro Products, only to come back 6
or 12 months later having discovered that DIY-ing an enterprise-ready
data science environment from open-source components is hard.

The most blunt tool an IT/Admin team has to keep bad actors out is
networking. If the network is secure, it's hard for bad actors to
*infiltrate* and hard for insiders to accidentally or intentionally
*exfiltrate* valuable data. That's why [Chapter @sec-ent-networks] is
about how enterprises approach networking to create highly secure
environments.

If you work in a small organization, it's likely that everyone in the
organization has access to nearly everything. As the organization gets
larger or security concerns rise, making sure that people have access to
the systems they need -- and only the systems they need -- becomes a
higher priority and sophisticated approaches are needed to keep the
solutions manageable. In [Chapter @sec-auth], you'll learn the basics of
how sophisticated organizations think about providing a way to log in to
different systems and how you can make use of those tools.

If the environment is secure, concerns turn to how to make sure it has
sufficient horsepower to support the users that need it, and how to make
sure that upgrades and other changes to the environment can be done
smoothly. That's why [Chapter @sec-ent-scale] is all about how
enterprises manage computational resources to ensure stability,
especially when a lot of them are needed.

Lastly, there are your concerns as a data scientist. In particular,
using open-source R and Python packages can be complicated in an
enterprise context. That's why [Chapter @sec-ent-pm] is all about the
difficulties I've observed for organizations using open-source packages
and the solutions I've seen work for those environments.

My hope is that by the time you've finished these chapters, you'll be in
great shape to articulate exactly the needs for your enterprise data
science environment and to be a great partner to IT/Admin when issues,
tension, or problems arise.

## (No) labs in this section

As this section is all about developing mental models and language to
have great collaboration with IT/Admins, there are no labs in this
section of the book. There are a lot of pictures and comprehension
questions to make sure you've really grasped the material.
