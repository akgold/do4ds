# IT/Admin for Data Science {#sec-3-intro}

You're a data scientist. Earlier in the book I also told you that you're
a software developer. But you're not an IT/Admin, and I'm not going to
make you one.

Unless you're feeling antsy for a career change, there's so much to know
about servers, networking, managing users, storage, and more. And being
responsible for a server is scary -- you can unknowingly make choices
that cause security vulnerabilities, system instability, and general
annoyance.

That said, you might find yourself administering a server. Maybe you're
a student who wants to host a portfolio for others to peruse, a hobbyist
who's hosting a toy project, or the data science leader who has no
choice but to host things for themselves because they just can't get
IT/Admin support.

And even if you're not the main server administrator, it's common for
data scientists to have some level of administrative access to the
servers they work on and share responsibility for some administration of
their work. Additionally, even if your IT/Admin team is stellar, it's
helpful to be able to speak their language.

There are two basic things IT/Admins do with servers: acquire and
administer the server itself and configure networking to securely allow
access to that server. This section of the book is designed to get you
comfortable with the basics of acquiring and running a Linux server and
configuring networking to securely and reliably connect to that server.

By the time you're done, you'll be ready to administer a simple
server-based environment for doing or deploying data science in the
cloud. And if you follow along with the labs, you'll actually have your
own data science workbench set up on an AWS EC2 instance.

## Labs in this Section

There are two basic reasons for data scientists to be interacting with a
server -- to share their work or to collaborate with other people in a
shared workbench. In the labs in this section, one in each chapter,
you'll get to try out both those things.

We're going to stand up an AWS EC2 instance and do two different things
there.

First, you'll host the Shiny app and API that we created in the first
two sections of the book. You'll learn how to host them there and how to
make them available to the Quarto site you've already got stood up.

Second, you'll create a data science workbench of your own. You'll stand
up RStudio Server and JupyterHub on a server so you can do further
development on whatever you like in a server-based environment.

For more details on what you'll do in each chapter, see [Appendix
@sec-append-lab].
