# IT/Admin for Data Science {#sec-3-intro}

Data scientists shouldn't be responsible for server administration.
There's a reason IT Administration is a career all to itself. There's so
much to know about servers, networking, managing users, storage, and
more.

You're probably great at writing R or Python code, cleaning and managing
data, or building models. Unless you feel like a career switch, managing
servers isn't in your core skillset.

And being responsible for a server is scary -- you can unknowingly make
choices that cause security vulnerabilities, system instability, and
general annoyance.

That said, there are good reasons you might find yourself administering
a server. Maybe you're a student who wants to host a project for
portfolio purposes, the hobbyist who's hosting a toy project, or the
data science leader who has no choice but to host things for themselves
because they just can't get IT/Admin support.

I've been in all of these situations. Believe, me *I feel you*.

The good news is that if you are in any of those roles, you've come to
the right place.

The first section of this book focused on how to move your data science
practices closer to the DevOps ideal by doing Dev better.

This section focuses on how to do Ops. In contrast to the first section,
which assumed a pretty high level of understanding and focused on best
practices, this section is a lot of introductory IT/Admin knowledge.
This section assumes you know nothing about how to administer a server
other than the tools introduced in [Section @sec-2-intro].

Throughout the chapters in this section, you're going to learn standard
patterns for simple administrative tasks for servers and apply those to
a data science use-case. By the time you're done, you'll be ready to
administer a simple server-based environment for doing or deploying data
science in the cloud.

So what exactly will you learn about in this section?

We'll start with an intro to the cloud -- what it is, how it works, and
how to make use of it for data science purposes. We'll then spend a
chapter on Linux administration. If you're using a server, it's going to
be a Linux server, and understanding how to administer a Linux server is
worth learning. We'll then spend three chapters on several facets of
networking, including a basic intro, how getting and using a domain name
works, and how to secure a server with SSL/HTTPS. Lastly, we'll get into
how to choose the size and type of server to use for your data science
purposes.

Each chapter in this section is accompanied by a *lab*. If you follow
along with the labs in this section, you'll get an AWS server configured
and ready to run RStudio Server, JupyterHub, and serve model predictions
out of a Docker Container. While these aren't all the things you could
want to do on a server, once you've learned to do these tasks, many
other things will be reasonably similar.

What you'll learn in this section and in the labs should be sufficient
for you to do data science on a server for a small group of data
scientists who you trust, assuming you're not using data that is
especially sensitive.

If this isn't you -- if you actually do have IT/Admin support, I'd still
recommend skimming this section, especially Chapters
[@sec-basic-networks], [@sec-dns], and [@sec-ssl]. Being able to
understand a little bit about networking will make it way easier to
communicate with the IT/Admin group at your organization.

And don't forget, there's still section 4 -- where you'll learn more
about how to communicate with IT/Admin professionals for issues that
really should be left to them.

Let's jump in!

## Labs in this Section

Each chapter in this section has a lab. This section is about building
out the backend around the website we created in the first section of
the book.

In this section you'll stand up an EC2 instance to serve as a workbench,
add tools to work in R or Python, and host your Dockerized model and
Shiny app there. We'll also add the Shiny app to the website you created
and make sure all the plumbing gets hooked up.

For more details on what you'll do in each chapter, see [Appendix
@sec-append-lab].
