# Compute at Enterprise Scale {#sec-ent-scale}

Many enterprise data science platforms have requirements that quickly
outstrip the capacity of a modest server. It's common to have way more
users than can fit on a single server or have to support intermittent
jobs that require more capacity than is affordable to have permanently
available.

Providing a platform that supports hundreds or thousands of users
requires the complexity of coordinating multiple servers. And as the
number of users and the importance of a data science platform rises,
downtime becomes more expensive, so the system's stability becomes
paramount.

This chapter will help you understand how enterprise IT/Admins think
about managing and scaling that many servers. It will also help you
figure out what you need to communicate to your organization's IT/Admins
so they can appropriately scale the environment.

## DevOps best practices

The process of standing up an environment comes in two stages. First the
servers and networking need to be *provisioned*, which involves creating
all the required resources. Once that's done, they must be *configured*,
which means installing and activating applications like Python, R,
JupyterHub, and RStudio Server.

The IT/Admin group manages anywhere from dozens to thousands of servers
in an enterprise. In many enterprises, provisioning and configuration
are done by separate groups. There is often one central team that
provisions servers, another central function that manages networking,
and another team that does configuration and application administration.

To keep that many servers manageable, the IT/Admin group tries to make
them standardized and interchangeable. This idea is often encompassed in
the adage that "servers should be cattle, not pets". That means that you
almost certainly won't be allowed to SSH in and make whatever changes
you might want as a data scientist.

::: callout-note
Avoiding this complexity is why many organizations are moving away from
directly managing servers. Instead, they outsource server management by
acquiring PaaS or SaaS software from cloud providers.
:::

Indeed, in many organizations, **no one** is allowed to SSH in and make
changes. Instead, all changes must go through a robust change management
process and are deployed via *Infrastructure as Code (IaC)* tools so the
environment can always be torn down and replaced quickly.

There are many different IaC tools that your IT/Admins may use. These
include Terraform, Ansible, CloudFormation (AWS's IaC tool), Chef,
Puppet, and Pulumi. Most of these tools can do both provisioning and
configuration; however, since most specialize in one or the other, many
organizations use a pair of them together.

::: callout-note
### No Code IaC

Some enterprises manage servers without IaC. These usually involve
writing extensive *run books* to tell another person how to configure
the servers. If your spidey sense is tingling, you're correct that this
probably isn't nearly as good as IaC. Learning that your enterprise
IT/Admin organization doesn't use IaC tooling is a red flag.
:::

Along with making deployments via IaC, organizations that follow DevOps
best practices use a Dev/Test/Prod setup for making changes to servers
and applications. The Dev and Test environments, often called *lower
environments,* are solely for testing changes to the environment itself.
To differentiate these environments from the data scientist's Dev and
Test environments, I often refer to this as *Staging*.[^3-3-ent-scale-1]

[^3-3-ent-scale-1]: You'll have to fight out who gets to claim the title
    Dev/Test/Prod for their environments with the IT/Admins at your
    organization. Be nice, they probably had the idea long before you
    did.

Generally, you won't have access to the Staging environment at all,
except for potentially doing user acceptance testing for changes there.

In this setup, promotion is a two-dimensional grid, with IT/Admins
working on changes to the environment in Staging and data scientists
working on data science projects in Dev and Test within the Prod
IT/Admin environment. Ultimately, the goal is to create an extremely
reliable Prod-Prod environment.

![](images/dev-test-prod.png){fig-alt="The IT/Admin promotes the complete staging environment, then the data scientist or IT/Admin promote within Prod."}

In enterprises, moves from staging to prod, including upgrades to
applications or operating systems or adding system libraries have rules
around them. They may need to be validated or approved by security. In
some highly regulated environments, the IT/Admin group may only be able
to make changes during specific times. This can cause tension between a
data scientist who wants a new library or version **now** and an
IT/Admin who can't move that fast.

In addition to changes from staging to prod, enterprises sometimes
undergo a complete rebuild of their environments. Many of those rebuilds
result from a move to the cloud, which can be a multi-year affair.

## Compute for many users

With many data scientists, you outstrip the ability of any one server --
even a big one -- to accommodate all the work that needs to get done.
How many data scientists it takes to overtax a single server depends
entirely on what data scientists do at your organization. You may hit it
with only one person if you do intensive simulation work or deep
learning. On the other hand, I've seen organizations that primarily work
on small data sets that can comfortably fit 50 concurrent users on a
single server.

Once you need multiple servers to support the data science team(s), you
must *horizontally scale*. There is a simple way to horizontally scale,
giving every user or group a standalone server. In some organizations
this can work very well. The downside is that this results in a lot of
environments. That can be a hassle for the IT/Admin to manage or they
delegate server management to the individual teams.

Many enterprises don't want a profusion of team-level data science
environments. Instead, they want to run one centralized service that
handles much of the organization's data science needs. Managing just one
environment simplifies operations in some ways but also drastically
increases the cost of downtime. For example, one hour of downtime for a
platform that supports 500 data scientists wastes over
\$25,000.[^3-3-ent-scale-2]

[^3-3-ent-scale-2]: Assuming a (probably too low) fully-loaded cost of
    \$100,000 and 2,000 working hours per year.

::: callout-note
### Measuring Uptime

Organizations often introduce *Service Level Agreements (SLAs)* or
*Operating Level Agreements (OLAs)* about how much downtime is allowed.
These limits are usually measured in *nines of uptime*, which refers to
the proportion of the time that the service is guaranteed to be online.
So, a *one-nine* service is guaranteed to be up 90% of the time,
allowing 36 days of downtime a year. A *five-nine* service is guaranteed
up 99.999% of the time, allowing only 5 1/4 minutes of annual downtime.
:::

Therefore, organizations that support enterprise data science platforms
focus seriously on avoiding downtime. Most have a *disaster recovery*
policy. Sometimes, that policy dictates maintaining frequent (often
nightly) snapshots so they can roll back to a known good state in case
of failure. Sometimes, it means a copy of the environment is waiting on
standby in case of an issue with the primary environment.

Other times, there are stiffer requirements that the environment does
not experience downtime at all. This requirement for limited cluster
downtime is often called *high availability*.

## Computing in clusters

Whether for horizontal scaling or high availability reasons, most
enterprises run their data science environments in a *load-balanced
cluster*, a set of servers (*nodes*) that operate together as one unit.
Ideally, working in a cluster feels the same as working in a
single-server environment, but there are multiple servers to add
computational power or provide resilience if one server fails.

For a cluster to operate as a single environment, the IT/Admin need to
solve two problems. First, they want to provide a single front door that
routes users to a node in the cluster, preferably without them being
aware of it happening. This is accomplished with a *load balancer*, a
kind of proxy server.

Second, they must ensure that the user can save things (*state*) on the
server and access that state even if they end up on a different node
later. This is accomplished by setting up storage so persistent data
doesn't stay on the nodes. Instead, it lives in separate storage, most
often a database and/or file share, that is symmetrically accessible to
all the nodes in the cluster.

![](images/lb-cluster.png){fig-alt="Users come to the load balancer, which sends them to the nodes, which connect to the state."}

If you are a solo data scientist reading this, please do not try to run
a load-balanced data science cluster. When you undertake load balancing,
you've tackled a distributed systems problem, which is inherently
difficult.

It's worth noting that load balancing doesn't eliminate the single
points of failure anathema to a high-availability setup. In fact, it's
possible to make your system **less stable** by carelessly load
balancing several nodes. For example, what if your load balancer were to
fail? How will the system be resilient to bad performance in the state
storage? Sophisticated IT/Admin organizations have answers to these
questions and standard ways they implement high availability.

of configuration, see [Appendix @sec-append-lb].

## Docker in enterprise = Kubernetes

Initially created at Google and released in 2014, the open-source
*Kubernetes (K8S, pronounced koo-ber-net-ees or kates for the
abbreviation)* is the way to run production services out of Docker
containers.[^3-3-ent-scale-3] Many organizations are moving toward
running most or all of their production work in Kubernetes.

[^3-3-ent-scale-3]: If you are pedantic, there are other tools for
    deploying Docker containers like Docker Swarm and Kubernetes is not
    limited to Docker containers. But for all practical purposes,
    production Docker = Kubernetes.

::: callout-note
Apparently, Kubernetes is an ancient Greek word for "helmsman".
:::

In a load-balanced cluster of servers, the IT/Admin must provision each
node and then configure applications on it. In Kubernetes, the IT/Admin
creates and registers a cluster of worker nodes. The only requirement
for the worker nodes is that they run Kubernetes. No application-level
configuration occurs on the nodes.

To run applications in a Kubernetes cluster, an IT/Admin tells the
cluster's *control plane* to run a set of Docker containers with a
certain amount of computational power allocated to each one. These
Docker Containers running in Kubernetes are called *pods*.

The elegance of Kubernetes is that the IT/Admin doesn't have to think
about where each pod goes. The control plane *schedules* the pods on the
nodes without a human having to consider networking or application
requirements.

![](images/k8s.png){fig-alt="Image of a Kubernetes cluster with 3 nodes and 6 pods of various sizes arranged across the nodes."}

From the IT/Admin's perspective, this is wonderful because they ensure
the cluster has sufficient horsepower and all the app requirements come
in the container, which makes node configuration trivial. The app's
authors are often responsible for building the Docker Containers,
removing one thing from the IT/Admin's to-do list.

For production purposes, pod deployments are usually managed with *Helm
charts*, the standard IaC way to declare what pods you want, how many
you need, and their relationships.

Almost any IT/Admin running Kubernetes can add nodes with a few clicks
because they're using a cloud provider's managed service: AWS's *EKS
(Elastic Kubernetes Service*, Azure's *AKS (Azure Kubernetes Service)*,
or GCP's *GKE (Google Kubernetes Engine)*.[^3-3-ent-scale-4]

[^3-3-ent-scale-4]: It's rare, but some organizations do run an on-prem
    Kubernetes cluster with Oracle's OpenShift.

Kubernetes is a powerful tool, and there are many reasons to like it.
But like most powerful tools, it's also complicated. Becoming a
proficient Kubernetes admin is a skill unto itself. These days, many
IT/Admins are trying to add Kubernetes to their list of skills. If you
have a competent Kubernetes admin, you should be in good shape, but you
should be careful that setting up your data science environment doesn't
become someone else's chance to learn Kubernetes.

## Sizing and scaling clusters

Your IT/Admin team probably knows a lot about how to run a cluster but
not much about how data scientists use computational resources. To run a
cluster for your work, they will need your help deciding how many
machines you need and how to size and configure those machines. Here are
some mental models I've found helpful to communicate with IT/Admin teams
about sizing and scaling an enterprise cluster.

Generally, organizations run the workbench in one cluster and the
deployment platform in a second. That's because the usage patterns are
very different between the two. From a resource perspective, a
deployment platform looks a lot like any other application hosting
platform. Your IT/Admin team will probably want help figuring out the
size, but they'll be comfortable with the basic idea.

A data science workbench, on the other hand, probably looks nothing like
the platforms your IT/Admin team is most used to supporting. A workbench
supports a relatively small number of professionals doing
computationally-intensive tasks, but in patterns that may be unusual for
the IT/Admin team to support.

Usually, a data science platform has a *baseline load*. For the
workbench, this is the average number of data professionals who visit on
a daily basis and the scale of the jobs they're running. For the
deployment platform, it's the number of jobs and app and API sessions
that run on a normal day. Aside from the total load for this work, the
IT/Admins will also need to know the minimum node size to support a
single session. For example, some organizations have a large cluster,
but each job could comfortably fit on a machine with 16 GB of RAM, but
that would be woefully inadequate for others.

Second, there's *burst usage*. This is extra capacity across both the
workbench and deployment environment that is sometimes needed to support
additional users, jobs, or applications. For example, your organization
might occasionally do workshops that pull in more users than usual, or
you're launching a new data science app that will add load to the
deployment cluster.

Last, there's the need for *special-purpose computational resources*.
These needs for very large or GPU-backed instances are usually transient
for particular projects with very large data or while training specific
machine learning models. These are common needs for a workbench
environment but are less likely in the deployment environment unless
you're re-training machine learning models on a schedule in the
deployment environment.

The IT/Admin team will be pleased if you can help them figure out a
reasonable estimate for each of the following:

1.  Baseline number of CPU cores, amount of RAM, and the largest jobs
    you'll have to accommodate daily for the workbench and deployment
    environment.
2.  Burst usage in terms of frequency, duration of burst demand, and
    amount of CPU cores and RAM as best you can estimate.
3.  Special-purpose needs in frequency, duration, job sizes, and GPU
    needs.

Most teams will find it unaffordable to keep all this capacity
continuously available, and your IT/Admin team will want to devise a
scaling strategy.

Usually, the IT/Admin team will target some always-on capacity, often
matching the baseline load. Ideally, this can be run on just one
machine. If not, running the appropriate number of approximately
laptop-sized machines is common. In AWS, this often means a certain
number of `t3.xlarges` with four CPU cores and 16 GB of RAM or
`t3.2xlarges` with twice that capacity.

When burst usage or special purpose machines are needed for a discrete
time (i.e., a day or longer), it's often easiest for an IT/Admin to
manually stand up more machines with IaC. That means creating a
temporary standalone environment for special-purpose projects or
manually expanding the size of an existing cluster.

However, manual adjustment doesn't work for some organizations.
Organizations with complex data source and authentication interactions
may be unable to create new clusters quickly. In others, organizational
rules and requirements might make it hard to stand up new nodes.

These other organizations often want to run only one cluster and may
want that cluster to scale itself automatically. Some very competent
IT/Admin teams can create a single autoscaling data science cluster, but
it's hard. I've often found that organizations trying for a single
cluster are besotted with the elegance of the idea and underestimate the
difficulty of making it work. You may have to impress upon your
IT/Admins that running heterogeneous workloads in one cluster isn't
trivial and that a data science workbench is a particularly awkward fit
for the autoscaling frameworks they probably prefer.

Autoscaling to make a cluster bigger is never a problem, but autoscaling
a workbench cluster back down is tricky. Most autoscaling frameworks
choose the cluster size based on actual resource usage (usually CPU).
But CPU usage is very uneven for a workbench cluster. Most activities in
a data science workbench, like typing code, debugging, or examining
data, use minuscule amounts of CPU. Your brain is cranking, but the CPU
is not.

That means a CPU-based autoscaling framework will register that node as
unused and think it's ok to autoscale away. As a cluster user, you will
experience this as a frustratingly unstable system. Autoscaling
frameworks that work well for a data science workbench need to have a
notion of active sessions that isn't based on moment-to-moment resource
usage.

These days, many IT/Admins automatically assume autoscaling means
Kubernetes, as it has powerful tools for managing cluster size.
Unfortunately, Kubernetes can be an awkward fit for a data science
workbench depending on your needs. First, Kubernetes pods are generally
limited to the size of the underlying nodes. So if you've got a cluster
of `t3.xlarge`s, pods are usually limited to 16 GB of RAM or less.
Second, Kubernetes autoscaling is usually CPU-based and you must trick
the Kubernetes scheduling engine to work well for a data science
workbench. Last, Kubernetes allows for heterogeneous nodes (e.g., large
or GPU-backed) in one cluster, but it's not a core use case and can be
awkward to configure.[^3-3-ent-scale-5]

[^3-3-ent-scale-5]: You, or your IT/Admin, will have to work with
    *taints*, *tolerations*, *node pool selectors*, *node affinities*,
    and more.

*High performance computing (HPC)* frameworks like *Slurm* are often a
better fit for a data science workbench. Most people think about HPC in
the context of supercomputing. That's because HPC allows users to
address a cluster of many machines as one, so you can have thousands of
CPU cores working on one job. But HPC also works quite well at a more
modest size, for example, to run a workload requiring 10 cores in a
cluster with only `t3.xlarge`s with 4 cores each.

Even if you don't have any node sizing issues, HPC can be an excellent
fit for autoscaling or a cluster with heterogeneous nodes. HPC
frameworks are generally quite session-aware, making them a good choice
for autoscaling a data science workbench. Most also support different
categories of work, often called *queues* or *partitions*, right out of
the box. If you're interested in trying out Slurm, AWS has a service
called *ParallelCluster* that allows users to set up an HPC cluster with
no additional cost beyond the EC2 instances in the cluster.

The upshot is that running a single data science cluster that autoscales
is hard. It's usually easier to create one-off data science environments
or manually scale a cluster. If your organization does want a single
environment, most IT/Admins will use a standard autoscaling framework or
Kubernetes, but HPC may be a better solution.
