# DNS allows for human-readable addresses {#sec-dns}

In [Chapter @sec-networks-1] you learned all about how IP addresses are
where a resource lives on a computer network. But you've been using the
internet for a long time and you've rarely -- if ever -- actually used
an IP address. What gives?

IP addresses are hard to remember. And worse, they can change when
servers are replaced or changed.

To make the internet a little more human-friendly, the creators of the
internet built the *domain name system* (DNS) that translates between
human-readable *domains* and the IP addresses where the resources
actually live.

When you create or launch a website, you'll purchase *domain* like
$do4ds.com$. Purchasing a domain (renting one, really) gives you the
right to attach that domain to an IP address so people can access the
resources you choose at that address.

[Chapter @sec-networks-1] introduced full URLs. Where the main address
goes, I handwaved a little because I was switching back and forth
between IP addresses and domains. In this chapter, we're going to get
really specific about how that substitution works, so we're going to
focus on the address part of it. In particular, we're going to learn
about Fully-Qualified Domain Names (FQDN).

A site's FQDN looks like this:

$$
\overbrace{https}^{\text{protocol}}://\overbrace{blog}^{\text{Subdomain}}.\underbrace{\overbrace{example}^{\text{Domain Name}}.\overbrace{com}^{\text{Top-Level Domain}}}_{\text{Root Domain}}
$$

The *root domain* is the thing you actually purchase. It has two parts.
The top-level domain specifies the root domain name server to use.

Each *domain name* is unique *only within the top-level domain*, so if
you own the root domain $example.com$, there's nothing stopping someone
else from getting $example.org$ or $example.ai$.

## So many top-level domains

If you feel like the number of top-level domains has exploded in the
last few years, you're right.

When the web first launched, there were only a limited number of
top-level domains like `.com`, `.org`, and `.net` and ICANN -- the group
that controls how domains are assigned -- controlled them all.

In 2013, ICANN decided to allow people and organizations to register
*their own* top-level domains. That's why there's been an explosion in
websites at top level domains like `.io`, `.ai`, and `.fun` in the last
decade or so.

I think it'd be fun to have my own top-level domain, so it's unfortunate
that owning a top-level domain is not something to do on a whim. In
2012, the initial application fee was \$185,000.
:::

The *protocol* is the application layer protocol, which we discussed in
some depth in [Chapter @sec-networks-1]. For most web traffic, the
protocol is `http`. We'll discuss where the `s` comes from in [Chapter
@sec-ssl] on SSL.

*Subdomains* are a way to specify a *part* of a domain, usually to
signify to users that its for a distinct purpose. If you control a
domain, you also have ownership over all the subdomains in that domain.

Subdomains are entirely about organizing how users experience your
website. They don't need to have any relationship to the technical
implementation of your website. For example, you might want to have a
blog for your engineering team at $example.com$. Whether you choose to
host it at $example.com/engineering/blog$ or at
$blog.engineering.example.com$ is purely a choice of user experience and
organizational preference.

Poking around different Google services illustrates the arbitrary-ness
of using subdomains vs paths. Some Google services are at subdomains.
Gmail is at $mail.google.com$ and Google Drive is at $drive.google.com$.
Each of these is a distinct site I might visit for different purposes,
but they're all owned and maintained by Google -- though probably by
different teams.

On the other hand, Google Maps is accessible at $maps.google.com$, but
it just redirects to $google.com/maps$. Google slides is also accessible
at $slides.google.com$ and redirects to a path on a subdomain:
$docs.google.com/presentation$. This most likely reflects internal
organizational divisions at Google.

::: callout-note
## `www` is just a subdomain

Sometimes the domains of websites are prefixed with `www` and sometimes
not. What gives?

`www` is just a subdomain. It's short for *world wide web*.

When the internet was first started, it seemed like it might be
important to differentiate the subdomain where the website would live
from, for example, the email domain people at that organization would
use.

That turned out not really to be the case.

These days, it is convention to make the `www` subdomain and the bare
domain go to the same place.

## How DNS lookups work

In [Chapter @sec-networks-1], we discussed how packets gets routed to
successively higher-level routers until there's one that knows where the
packet is going and sends it back down. It turns out that this process
essentially happens *twice.* The first time is to get the IP address for
the domain in a process called *DNS resolution.* The second time is when
it actually sends the information to that IP address.

You can see the basic structure of a DNS lookup using the terminal
command `nslookup`. Here's the DNS routing for $google.com$:

     ❯ nslookup google.com                                              
    Server:     192.168.86.1
    Address:    192.168.86.1#53

    Non-authoritative answer:
    Name:   google.com
    Address: 142.251.163.113
    Name:   google.com
    Address: 142.251.163.100
    Name:   google.com
    Address: 142.251.163.138
    Name:   google.com
    Address: 142.251.163.101
    Name:   google.com
    Address: 142.251.163.102
    Name:   google.com
    Address: 142.251.163.139

These addresses do change periodically, so they may no longer be valid
by the time you read this. But if you want to go do an `nslookup`
yourself, you can visit one of those IP addresses and see that it takes
you right to the familiar $google.com$.[^3-4-dns-1]

[^3-4-dns-1]: If you try to do an `nslookup` on some websites -- like
    $do4ds.com$, you'll notice the IP address doesn't actually take you
    to this book's site. That's because this book isn't actually hosted
    directly on a server. It's instead hosted on GitHub pages -- so the
    IP addresses `nslookup` finds are the Google Pages servers, which
    themselves know how to resolve $do4ds.com$.

DNS resolution is actually quite a complex process because every
computer in the world needs to be able to resolve a DNS entry to the
same IP address in a timely fashion. The simplest form of DNS lookup
would be easy -- there would just be one nameserver with the top-level
domains and then one server for each top-level domain.

There are two problems with this theoretical DNS lookup -- it wouldn't
be very resilient because of a lack of redundancy and it would be
*slow*. In order to speed things up, the DNS system is highly
decentralized.

Along with decentralization, DNS resolution relies on a lot of cacheing.
When your computer or an intermediate DNS server looks up an IP address
for you, it caches it. This is because its likely that if you've looked
up a domain once, you're going to do it again soon.

This is great if you are *using* the internet and don't want to wait for
DNS lookups, but when you're changing the domains on servers you
control, there are thousands of public DNS servers that a request could
get routed to, and many of them may have outdated cache entries. DNS
changes can take up to 24 hours to propagate.

That means that if you make a change and it's not working, you have no
idea whether you made a mistake or it just hasn't propagated yet. It's
very annoying.

Sometimes, using a private browsing window will cause DNS cache
refreshes, but not always.

## How DNS is configured

From the perspective of someone trying to set up their own website,
there's only one DNS server that matters to you personally -- the DNS
server for your *domain name registrar*.

Domain name registrars are the companies that actually own domains. You
can buy or rent one from them in order to have a domain on the internet.

Your first stop would be a domain name registrar where you'd find an
available domain you like and pull out your credit card.

Costs for domain names vary widely. Buying a meaningless domain in a
less popular top-level domain, say `ladskfmlsdf.me` can cost as little
as \$3 per year. On the other hand, buying a `.com` domain that's a real
word or phrase can be a few thousand dollars. There are articles every
few years about some major company accidentally allowing their domain
name to lapse and ransoming it back for stupid amounts of money.

Configuration of DNS is done by way of *records*, of which there are a
menagerie of types you *can* configure. Luckily, most simple
configurations only need *CNAME* and *A* records.

Here's an imaginary DNS record table for the domain `example.com`:

| Path/Host | Type  | Target         |
|-----------|-------|----------------|
| `@`       | A     | `143.122.8.32` |
| `www`     | CNAME | example.com    |
| `*`       | A     | `143.122.8.33` |

Let's go through how to read this table.

Since we're configuring `example.com`, the paths/hosts in this table are
relative to `example.com`.

In the first row we're configuring an A record to go to the target IP
address. *A records* (or their IPv6 cousin *AAAA records*) map a domain
to an actual IP address. The path `@` is a special symbol meaning exact
match. So by this configuration, any traffic to `example.com` will be
passed straight through to the specified IP address.

The second row deals with traffic to the `www` subdomain. *CNAME
records* alias sub-domains. They're most frequently used to map
sub-domains to the main domain. Since this is a `CNAME` record for
example.com, this record indicates that traffic to www.example.com
should be treated exactly like traffic to `example.com`. Some domain
providers do automatic redirection of `www` traffic, and so this row may
not be necessary in some configurations.

The last record uses the wildcard symbol `*` to send all subdomain
traffic that's not already spoken for -- say `blog.example.com` or
`info.example.com` directly to the IP address specified. In this case,
I'm sending all of those subdomains to a different IP address, maybe a
404 (not found) page -- or maybe I'm serving all the subdomains off a
different server.

So what happens is that your query goes through several layers of public
DNS servers to get to the DNS entry for your domain name registrar. In
many cases, you'll directly configure your domain name registrar to
point to your website or server -- but you also can configure the domain
name registrar to point at another set of DNS servers you actually
control with an *NS record*.

If you're setting up your own server, this probably isn't the case, but
some large enterprises do run their own private DNS servers.

TODO

## Lab: Configuring DNS for your server

::: callout-warning
In [Chapter @sec-ssl], we'll secure your server with an SSL certificate
and `https`. You absolutely should not use your server for anything real
until you've configured SSL.
:::

### Step 1: Allocate Elastic IP

If you've restarted your server, you've probably noticed that the IP
address changed!

This can be a real pain if you have to reconfigure your DNS every time.
AWS offers a service called Elastic IP that gives you an IP address that
won't change that you can use with your instance, even if you restart
it.

As of this writing, Elastic IPs are free as long as it's associated with
a single running EC2 instance. You get charged if they're not active --
basically AWS doesn't want you hoarding Elastic IPs. Great -- just make
sure to give back the elastic IP if you take down your instance.

::: callout-note
If you were doing this for real, and not in a somewhat arbitrary order
that's grouped by topic, it would've made sense to set up the elastic IP
as soon as you brought the server up so you only would've used that IP
address.
:::

Go to Elastic IP and click allocate. Once it has been allocated, you'll
need to associate it with the existing Instance you created. Choose the
instance and the default private IP address.

Note that once you make this change, your server will no longer be
available at its old IP address, so you'll have to ssh in at the new
one. If you have SSH terminals open when you make the change, they will
break.

### Step 2: Buy a domain

This part will not be free, but it can be very cheap. The easiest way to
do this is via AWS's Route53 service. You can get domains on Route53 for
as little as \$9 per year -- but there are even cheaper services. For
example, I was able to get the domain $do4ds-lab.shop$ for \$1.98 for a
year on $namecheap.com$.

### Step 3: Configure DNS

Once you've got your domain, you have to configure your DNS. You'll have
to create 2 A records -- one each for the \@ host and the \* host
pointing to your IP and one for the CNAME at the www with the value
being your bare domain.

So in NameCheap, my Advanced DNS configuration looks like this:

![](images-traffic/namecheap-config.png)

### Step 4: Wait an annoyingly long time

Now you just have to be patient. Unfortunately DNS takes time to
propagate. After a few minutes (or hours?), your server should be
reachable at your domain.

If it's not (yet) reachable, try seeing if an incognito browser works.
If it doesn't, wait some more. When you run out of patience, try
reconfiguring everything and check if it works now.
