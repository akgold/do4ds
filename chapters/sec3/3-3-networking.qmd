# Intro to Computer Networks {#sec-basic-networks}

These days using a computer is basically synonymous with using a
computer network. When you visit a website, print a document, or login
to your email, you are making use of a computer network.

This chapter is an introduction to how computer networks work. This
chapter is heavy on introducing mental models for how network traffic
works. There is no lab in this chapter.

The computer network we're most familiar with is the biggest of them
all: The Internet. But there are myriad other networks, like the very
small private network of the devices (phones, computers, TVs, etc)
connected to your home wifi router, to the somewhat larger VPN (which
stands for virtual private network) you might connect to for school or
work.

The good news is that computer networks are basically all the same. If
you understand one, you understand them all. Each step in the process is
governed by a *protocol* that defines what is valid.

There are two basic levels of protocols that are helpful to understand
-- the transport + address layer, and the application layer.

Just as you and your friend could communicate in any number of human
languages, computers define what a valid message is with an *application
layer protocol*.

There are numerous application layer protocols. Some you will see in
this book include `SSH` for access to the terminal on a remote machine,
`(S)FTP` for file transfers, `SMTP` for email, `LDAP(S)` for
authentication and authorization, and `websockets` for persistent
bi-directional communication, which is what the Shiny and Streamlit
packages use.

The most common application layer protocol, used for all standard web
traffic, is **h**yper**t**ext **t**ransfer **p**rotocol (*http*), which
we discussed in some depth in [Chapter @sec-apis] on using APIs for data
science purposes.

For the purposes of this chapter, we're going to completely set aside
physical network infrastructure. Yes, there are wires, cables,
satellites, routers, server farms, and more that allow computer
networking to work. For the purposes of this chapter, we're going to
focus entirely on the software side of networking.

One cool thing about the cloud is that it allows you to abstract away
all of the physical hardware and focus completely on how the software
interacts.

## TCP/IP and the mail

Let's start by imagining you have a penpal, who lives in an apartment
building across the country.[^3-3-networking-1]

[^3-3-networking-1]: For this analogy to work, everyone lives in
    apartment buildings rather than standalone houses.

Let's say you've got some juicy gossip to share with your penpal.
Because this gossip is so juicy, you're not going to put it on a
postcard. You'd write your letter, put it inside an envelope, address
the letter to the right spot, and put it in the mail.

You trust the postal service to take your letter, deliver it to the
correct address, and then your friend will be able to read your letter.

The process of actualy getting data from one computer to another is
governed by the *TCP/IP* protocol and is called *packet
switching*.[^3-3-networking-2]

[^3-3-networking-2]: TCP and IP are actually two separate protocols at
    different layers of the protocol stack. But they're so closely
    linked that we can talk about them as one.

When a computer has data to send to another computer, it takes that
information and packages it up into a bundle called a
*packet*.[^3-3-networking-3]

[^3-3-networking-3]: One of the biggest ways the mail *is not* like
    packet switching is that your message gets chopped up among lots of
    different packets, which are routed independently, and are
    reassembled when they get where they're going. Works well for
    computers, not so well for real-world mail. It's also pretty much an
    irrelevant detail, since this whole process works quite invisibly.

The data in the packet is like the contents of your letter.

Just as the postal service defines permissible envelope sizes and
address formats, the *TCP/IP* protocol defines what a packet has to look
like from the outside, including what constitutes a valid address.

A uniform resource locator (URL) is the way to address a specific
resource on a network.

A full URL includes 4 pieces of information: $$
\overbrace{\text{https://}}^\text{protocol}\overbrace{\text{example.com}}^\text{address}\overbrace{\text{:443}}^\text{port}\overbrace{\text{/}}^\text{resource}
$$

The protocol starts the URL. It is separated from the rest of the URL by
`://`.

Each of the rest of the pieces of the URL is needed to get to a specific
resource and has a real-world analog.

The address is like the street address of your penpal's building. It
specifies the host where your data should go.[^3-3-networking-4]

[^3-3-networking-4]: Often it's not a single server at the address --
    but it behaves like one. It could instead be a proxy in front of a
    cluster of servers or even more complicated routing. All that
    matters is that it behaves like a single server from the outside.

A host is any entity on a network that can receive requests and send
responses. So a server is a common type of host on a network, but so is
a router, your laptop, and a printer.

The port is like your friend's apartment. It specifies which service on
the server to address.

Lastly, the resource dictates what resource you want on the server. It's
like the name on the address of the letter, indicating that you're
writing to your penpal, not their mom or sister.

This full URL may look a little strange to you. You're probably used to
just putting a standalone domain like $google.com$ into your browser
when you want to go to a website. That's because `https`, port `443`,
and `/` are all defaults, so modern browsers don't make you specify
them.

But what if you make it explicit? Try going to
`https://google.com:443/`. What do you get?

## Ports get you to the right service

A port is a location on a server where a network connection is possible.
It's like the apartment number for the mail. Each port has a unique
number 1 to just over 65,000. By default, the overwhelming majority of
the ports on the server are closed for security reasons.

Your computer automatically opens ports to make outgoing connections,
but if you want to allow someone to make inbound connections -- like to
access RStudio or a Shiny app on a server -- you need to manually
configure and open a port.

Any program that is running on a server and that you intend to be
accessible from the outside is called a service. For example, we set up
RStudio, JupyterHub, and a Plumber API as services in the lab in
[Chapter @sec-linux-admin]. Each service lives on a unique port on the
server.

Since each service running on a server needs a unique port, it's common
to choose a somewhat random relatively high-numbered port. That makes
sure it's unlikely that the port will conflict with another service
running on the server.

For example RStudio Server runs on port `8787` by default. According to
JJ Allaire, there's no special meaning to this port. It was chosen
because it was easy to remember and not `8888`, which some other popular
projects had taken.

### Special Port Cheatsheet

All ports below 1024 are reserved for common server tasks, so you can't
assign services to low-numbered ports.

There are also three common ports that will come up over and over. These
are handy because if you're using the relevant service, you don't have
to indicate if it's using the default port.

| Protocol | Default Port |
|----------|--------------|
| HTTP     | 80           |
| HTTPS    | 443          |
| SSH      | 22           |

## Assigning addresses

The proper address of a server on a network is defined by the *Internet
Protocol* (IP) and is called an *IP Address*. IP addresses are mapped to
human-friendly domains like $google.com$ with the *Domain Name Service
(DNS)*.

::: callout-note
In this chapter, we're going to set DNS aside and talk exclusively about
IP Addresses.

[Chapter @sec-dns-ssl] is all about DNS.
:::

Every host on the internet has a public IP address.

A public IP address is an IP address that is valid across the entire
internet. That means that each public IP address is unique across the
entire internet. You can think of a public IP address like the public
street address of a building.

But many hosts are not publicly accessible on the internet. Many are
housed in private networks. A private network is one where the hosts
aren't directly accessible to the public. You can think of a host in a
private network like a building inside a gated community. You may still
be able to get there from the public, but you can't just walk up to the
building from the street. Instead you need to come in through the
specific gates that have been permitted and approach only on the roads
that are allowed.

TODO: Image of public IPs like street address, private like cul-de-sac

There are many different kinds of private networks. Some are small and
enforced by connection to a physical endpoint, like the private network
your WiFi router controls that houses your laptop, phone, TV, Xbox, and
anything else you allow to connect to your router. In other cases, the
network is a software network. Many organizations have virtual private
networks (VPNs). In this case, you connect to the network via software.
There may be resources you can only connect to inside your VPN and there
also might be limitations about what you can go out and get.

There are a few different reasons for this public/private network split.
The first is security. If you've got a public IP address, anyone on the
internet can come knock on your virtual front door. That's actually not
so bad. What's more problematic is that they can go all the way around
the building looking for an unlocked side door. Putting your host inside
a private network is a way to ensure that people can only approach the
host through on the pathways you intend.

The second reason is convenience.

Private networks provide a nice layer of abstraction for network
addresses.

You probably have a variety of network-enabled devices in your home,
from your laptop and phone to your TV, Xbox, washing machine, and smart
locks. But from the outside, your house has only one public IP address
-- the address of the router in your home. That means that your router
has to keep track of all the devices you've got, but they don't need to
register with any sort of public service just to be able to use the
internet.

As we'll get into in [Chapter @sec-dns], keeping track of IP Addresses
is best left to machines. If you're managing a complex private network,
it's really nice to give *hostnames* to individual hosts. A nice feature
of a private hostname compared to a public address is that you don't
have to worry if the hostname is unique across the entire internet -- it
just has to be unique inside your private network.

### Firewalls, allow-lists, and other security settings

One of the most basic ways to keep a server safe is to not allow traffic
from the outside to come in. Generally that means that in addition to
keeping the server ports themselves closed, you'll also have a firewall
up that defaults to all ports being closed.

In AWS, the basic level of protection for your server is called the
security group. If you remember, we used a default security group in
launching your server. When you want to go add more services to your
server, you'll have to open additional ports both on the server and in
the security group.

In addition to keeping particular ports closed, you can also set your
server to only allow incoming traffic from certain IP addresses. This is
generally a very coarse way to do security, and rather fragile. For
example, you could configure your server to only accept incoming
requests from your office's IP address, but what if someone needs to
access the server from home or the office's IP address is reassigned?

One thing that is *not* a security setting is just using a port that's
hard to guess. For example, you might think, "Well, if I were to put SSH
on port 2943 instead of 22, that would be safer because it's harder to
guess!" I guess so, but it's really just an illusion of security. There
are ways to make your server safer. Choosing esoteric port numbers
really isn't it.

## How packets are routed

The way packets travel from one computer to another is called routing. A
router is a hardware or software device that route packets.

You can think of routers and public networks as existing in trees. Each
router knows about the IP addresses downstream of it and also the single
upstream *default address*.[^3-3-networking-5]

[^3-3-networking-5]: There are actually a few different types of
    addresses used to do this. IP addresses are used for identifying
    network resources and the MAC address used for physical hardware.
    Your router is also responsible for assigning IP addresses to
    devices as they join the network via the dynamic host configuration
    protocol (DHCP). I'm glossing over all these details as they're
    immaterial to the understanding important for this chapter.

TODO: diagram of routers in trees

For example, the router in your house just keeps track of the actual
devices that are attached to it. So if you were to print something from
your laptop, the data would just go to your router and then to your
printer.

On the other hand, when you look at a picture on Instagram, that traffic
has to go over the public network. The default address for your home's
router is probably one owned by your internet service provider (ISP) for
your neighborhood. And that router's default address is probably also
owned by your ISP, but for a broader network.

So your packet will get passed upstream to a sufficiently general
network and then back downstream to the actual address you're trying to
reach.

Meanwhile, your computer just waits for a response. Once the server has
a response to send, it comes back using the same technique. Obviously a
huge difference between sending a letter to a penpal and using a
computer network is the speed. Where sending a physical letter takes a
minimum of days, sending and receiving packets over a network is so fast
that the delay is imperceptible when you're playing a multiplayer video
game or collaborating on a document online.

## How to recognize an IP address

You've probably seen IPv4 addresses many times. They're four blocks of
8-bit fields (numbers between `0` and `255`) with dots in between, so
they look something like `65.77.154.233`.

If you do the math, you'll realize there are "only" about 4 billion of
these. While we can stretch those 4 billion IP addresses to many more
devices since most devices only have private IPs, we are indeed running
out of public IPv4 addresses.

The good news is that smart people started planning for this a while
ago. In the last few years, adoption of the new IPv6 standard has
started. IPv6 addresses are eight blocks of hexadecimal (`0-9` + `a-f`)
digits separated by colons, with certain rules that allow them to be
shortened, so `4b01:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334` or `3da4:66a::1`
are both examples of valid IPv6 addresses.

IPv6 will coexist with IPv4 for a few decades and we'll eventually
switch entirely to IPv6. There's no worry about running out of IPv6
addresses any time soon, because the total quantity of IPv6 addresses is
a number with 39 zeroes.

### Reserved IP Addresses

Most IPv4 addresses are freely available to be assigned, but there are a
few that you'll see in particular contexts and it's useful to know what
they are.

The first IP address you'll see a lot is `127.0.0.1`, also known as
`localhost` or loopback. This is the way a machine refers to itself.

For example, if you open a Shiny app in RStudio Desktop, the app will
pop up in a little window along with a notice that says

`Listening on http://127.0.0.1:6311`

That `http://127.0.0.1` is indicating that your computer is serving the
Shiny app to itself on the localhost address.

There are also a few blocks of addresses that are reserved for use on
private networks, so they're never assigned in public.

+----------------------------+----------------------------------------+
| Code                       | Meaning                                |
+============================+========================================+
| 127.0.0.1                  | `localhost` or loopback -- the machine |
|                            | that originated the request            |
+----------------------------+----------------------------------------+
| 192.168.x.x                | Protected address blocks used for      |
|                            | private IP addresses.                  |
| 172.16.x.x.x               |                                        |
|                            |                                        |
| 10.x.x.x                   |                                        |
+----------------------------+----------------------------------------+

You don't really need to remember these, but it's very likely you've
seen an address like `192.168.0.1` or `192.168.1.1` if you've ever tried
to configure a router or modem for your home wifi.

Now you know why.

## Basic network troubleshooting

Networking can be difficult to manage because there are so many layers
where it can go awry. Let's say you've configured a service on your
server, but you just can't seem to access it.

The `ping` command can be useful for checking whether your server is
reachable on the network. For example, here's what happens when I `ping`
the domain where this book sits.

    > ping -o do4ds.com                                                                        
    PING do4ds.com (185.199.110.153): 56 data bytes
    64 bytes from 185.199.110.153: icmp_seq=0 ttl=57 time=13.766 ms

    --- do4ds.com ping statistics ---
    1 packets transmitted, 1 packets received, 0.0% packet loss
    round-trip min/avg/max/stddev = 13.766/13.766/13.766/0.000 ms

This looks great -- it sent 1 packet to the server and got one back.
That's exactly what I want. Seeing an unreachable host or packet loss
would be an indication that my networking probably isn't configured
correctly somewhere between me and the server. I generally like to use
`ping` with the `-o` option for sending just **o**ne packet -- as
opposed to continuously trying.

If `ping` fails, it means that my server isn't reachable. The things I'd
want to check is that I have the URL for the server correct, that DNS is
configured correctly (see [Chapter @sec-dns]), that I've correctly
configured any firewalls to have the right ports open (Security Groups
in AWS), and that any intermediate networking devices are properly
configured (see more on proxies in [Chapter @sec-ent-networks]).

If `ping` succeeds but I still can't access the server, `curl` is good
to check. `curl` actually attempts to fetch the website at a particular
URL. It's often useful to use `curl` with the `-I` option so it just
returns a simple status report, not the full contents of what it finds
there.

For example, here's what I get when I `curl` CRAN from my machine.

     > curl -I https://cran.r-project.org/                                                         
     
    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Date: Sun, 15 Jan 2023 15:34:19 GMT
    Server: Apache
    Last-Modified: Mon, 14 Nov 2022 17:33:06 GMT
    ETag: "35a-5ed71a1e393e7"
    Accept-Ranges: bytes
    Content-Length: 858
    Vary: Accept-Encoding
    Content-Type: text/html

The important thing here is that first line. The server is returning a
`200` HTTP status code, which means all is well. For more on HTTP status
codes and how to interpret them, see [Chapter @sec-apis].

If `ping` succeeds, but `curl` does not, it means that the server is up
at the expected IP address, but the service is not accessible. At that
point, you might check whether the right ports are accessible -- it's
possible to (for example) have port 443 or 80 accessible on your server,
but not the port you actually need for your service. You also might
check on the server itself that the service is running and that it is
running on the port you think it is.

If you're running inside a container, you should check that you've
properly configured the port inside container to be forwarded to the
outside.

## Comprehension Questions

1.  What are the 4 components of a URL? What's the significance of each?
2.  What are the two things a router keeps track of? How does it use
    each of them?
3.  Are there any inherent differences between public and private IP
    addresses?
4.  What is the difference between an IP address and a port?
5.  Let's say you've got a server at 54.33.115.12. Draw a mind map of
    what happens when you try to SSH into the server. Your explanation
    should include the terms: IP Address, port, 22, default address,
    router, sever.

## Lab: Making it accessible in one place

::: callout-note
This lab is somewhat advanced. If you just wanted to run one service on
your server -- say just RStudio or just the Plumber API, you could skip
this lab and just configure the service to be available on port 80
and/or 443.
:::

In this lab, we're going to go from having to SSH tunnel to be able to
use your data science workbench to making it available over the
internet. That means we're going to have to do 2 things: configure the
networking to allow HTTP traffic and configure a real domain for our
server.

Right now RStudio Server is ready to serve traffic inside our server on
port `8787`, JupyterHub is on `8000`, and our Palmer Penguins API is on
`8555`. But right now nothing can get to them. So the first step is to
allow traffic in.

The easiest thing we could do would be to just open up ports `8787` and
`8000` to the world. It's not the right answer, but it will "work".

::: callout-tip
If you do want to try it to prove to yourself, go to the settings for
your server's security group and just add a custom TCP rule allowing
access to ports `8787`, `8000`, and `8555` from anywhere. If you visit
`$SERVER_ADDRESS:8787` you should get RStudio, similarly with JupyterHub
at `$SERVER_ADDRESS:8000`, and the API at `$SERVER_ADDRESS:8555`.

Ok, now close those ports back up so we can do this the right way.
:::

If you did it this way, your users would have to remember these
arbitrary ports to use your server. It's also insecure because there
isn't a good way to secure these ports with SSL.[^3-3-networking-6]

[^3-3-networking-6]: As of this writing, JupyterHub supports configuring
    SSL in the product, but RStudio Server does not. Posit Workbench,
    the paid version of RStudio Server does support SSL configuration.

The common solution to wanting to serve multiple services off of one
server is to use a proxy. A proxy is a network device that reroutes
traffic in various ways. [Chapter @sec-ent-networks] has more detail on
proxies and why they're a pain.

For the purpose of this lab, I'm going to give you a pre-built proxy to
use.

Here are the steps to take on your server:

1.  Install nginx with `sudo apt install nginx`.
2.  Save a backup of `nginx.conf`,
    `cp /etc/nginx/nginx.conf /etc/nginx/nginx-backup.conf`.[^3-3-networking-7]
3.  Edit the nginx configuration with `sudo vim /etc/nginx/nginx.conf`
    and replace it with:

[^3-3-networking-7]: This is generally a good practice before you start
    messing with config files. Bad configuration is usually preferable
    to a service that can't start at all because you've messed up the
    config so badly. It happens.

``` {filename="/etc/nginx/nginx.conf"}
http {
  
  \# Enable websockets (needed for Shiny)
  map \$http_upgrade \$connection_upgrade { 
    default upgrade; '' close; 
  }
  
  server { listen 80;
    
    location /rstudio/ {
      # Needed only for a custom path prefix of /rstudio
      rewrite ^/rstudio/(.*)$ /$1 break;
      
      # Use http here when ssl-enabled=0 is set in rserver.conf
      proxy_pass http://localhost:8787;
      
      proxy_http_version 1.1;
      proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
      proxy_set_header Connection $connection_upgrade;
      proxy_read_timeout 20d;
      
      # Not needed if www-root-path is set in rserver.conf
      proxy_set_header X-RStudio-Root-Path /rstudio;
      
      # Optionally, use an explicit hostname and omit the port if using 80/443
      proxy_set_header Host $host:$server_port;
    }
    
    location /jupyter/ {
      # NOTE important to also set base url of jupyterhub to /jupyter in its config
      proxy_pass http://127.0.0a.1:8000;
      
      proxy_redirect   off;
      proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
      proxy_set_header Host $host;
      proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
      proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
      
      # websocket headers
      proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
      proxy_set_header Connection $connection_upgrade;
    }
    
    location /palmer/ {
    #TODO
    }
  }
```

4.  Test that your configuration is valid `sudo nginx -t`.
5.  Start nginx `sudo systemctl start nginx`. If you see nothing all is
    well.

If you need to change anything, update the config and then restart with
`sudo systemctl restart nginx`.

There's one more thing you'll have to do, which is to let RStudio and
JupyterHub know that they're on a subpath. Complex web apps like RStudio
and JupyterHub frequently send people to a different subpath internally.
In order to do so properly, they need to know to prepend all of those
requests with the subpath.

RStudio accepts a header from the proxy that lets it know what path it's
on (see the `X-RStudio-Root-Path` header line in the nginx config).
Jupyter needs to be explicitly told.

If you recall, we autogenerated the JupyterHub config with

     jupyterhub --generate-config
     sudo mkdir /etc/jupyterhub
     sudo mv jupyterhub_config.py /etc/jupyterhub

So you can go edit it with
`sudo vim /etc/jupyterhub/jupyterhub_config.py`.

Find the line that reads `# c.JupyterHub.bind_url = 'http://:8000'`.

::: callout-tip
You can search in vim from normal mode with
`/ <thing you're searching for>`. Go to the next hit with `n`.
:::

Uncomment that line and add a `/jupyter` on the end, so it reads
`c.JupyterHub.bind_url = 'http://:8000/jupyter'`.

Start jupyterhub with a specific config file.

We already daemonized JupyterHub, you restarting it with
`sudo systemctl restart jupyterhub` should pick up the new config.
