# Auth in Enterprise {#sec-auth}

Imagine you're suddenly responsible for managing access to the services
and data in an enterprise. You've got dozens of people joining, leaving,
or changing roles each week -- and there could be dozens or hundreds of
systems they might need to access. And complying with the principle of
least privilege means you don't want to give everyone access to
everything. Managing who is allowed to do what could be a major
headache.

One thing you almost certainly want to avoid is individual people
running services and deciding how to secure standalone systems. Instead,
you want to centralize the process of giving people access to the
services they need, called *auth*, inside the IT/Admin group.

If you work in an enterprise, you'll almost certainly have to work with
the organization's corporate auth to log in to your data science
workbench and use data sources. Additionally, if you're advocating for a
data science environment at your organization, you'll probably be given
IT/Admin requirements related to auth. This chapter is designed to help
you understand how IT/Admins think about auth and the technologies they
have to make it work.

::: callout-note
This chapter will help you understand a mental model for auth and the
available technologies. If you're curious about the technical operation
of these technologies, there's more detail on each in [Appendix
@sec-append-auth].

## A gentle introduction to auth

Consider all of the services in an enterprise that require auth: email,
databases, servers, social media accounts, HR systems, and more. Let's
picture each of those services as a room in a building.

Now, imagine yourself as the person who's in charge of auth. Your job is
to give everyone access to the rooms they need and **only** the rooms
they need.

First, you need a way to ascertain and validate the identity of anyone
trying to enter a room; to do that, you'll need to issue and verify
*credentials*. The most common computer credentials are a username and
password, but they are relatively insecure, and more secure alternatives
are on the rise. These include passkeys, biometrics like fingerprints
and facial identification, multi-factor codes, push notifications on
your phone, and ID cards. The process of verifying credentials is called
*authentication (authn)*.

But in an enterprise context, just knowing that someone has valid
credentials is insufficient. Remember, not every person gets to access
every system or every feature of every system. You'll also need a way to
check their *permissions*, which is the binary choice of whether they
can take an action like accessing a service. The permissions checking
process is called *authorization (authz)*. The combination of authn and
authz comprise auth.

Many organizations start simply. They add services one at a time and
allow each to use built-in functionality to issue service-specific
usernames and passwords to users. This would be similar to posting a
guard at each room's door to create a unique credential for each user.

![](images/simple_auth.png){fig-alt="A user logging into 3 different services with 3 different usernames and passwords."
width="600"}

This quickly becomes a mess for everyone. It's bad for users because
they either need to keep many credentials straight or reuse the same
ones, which is insecure. And as an IT/Admin, adding, removing, or
changing permissions is cumbersome, because each system has to be
changed individually.

## Centralizing user management with LDAP/AD

In the mid-1990s, an open protocol called *LDAP (Lightweight Directory
Access Protocol, pronounced ell-dapp)* became popular. LDAP allows
services to collect usernames and passwords and send them to a central
LDAP database for verification. The LDAP server sends back information
on the user, often including their username and groups, which the
service can use to authorize the user. Microsoft implemented LDAP as a
piece of software called *Active Directory* *(AD)* that became so
synonymous with LDAP that the technology is often called LDAP/AD.

Switching to LDAP/AD is like changing the door guarding process so the
guard will radio in the user's credentials and you'll radio back if
those credentials are valid. This is a vast improvement as having only
one set of credentials makes life easier for users. We know now that all
the rooms are using a similar level of security and if credentials are
compromised, it's easy to swap them out.

![](images/ldap-ad.png){fig-alt="A user logging into different services with the same username and password with an LDAP/AD server in the back."
width="600"}

LDAP/AD also provides a straightforward way to create Linux users with a
home directory, so it's often used in data science workbench contexts
that have that requirement.

LDAP/AD is being phased out in many organizations. LDAP/AD predates the
rise of the cloud and SaaS services. It is usually used on-prem and has
limited features relative to SSO providers.

Additionally, LDAP/AD requires that the service request the user
credentials and pass them along, which is a potential security risk. It
also means it's usually impossible to incorporate now-common
requirements like *multi-factor authentication (MFA)*. Many
organizations are getting rid of their LDAP/AD implementations and are
adopting a smoother user and admin experience with cloud-friendly
technologies.

::: callout-note
It's worth noting that LDAP/AD isn't an auth technology at all. It's a
type of database that happens to be particularly well-suited to managing
users in an organization. So even as many organizations are switching to
more modern systems, they may be wrappers around user data stored in an
existing LDAP/AD system.

## The rise of Single Sign On (SSO)

*Single Sign On (SSO)* is when you log in once to a standalone *identity
provider* at the start of your workday. The identity provider gives you
a secure *SSO token* that is responsible for granting access to various
services you might use.[^3-2-auth-1] Usually, the acquisition and
management of SSO tokens are hidden from the user, resulting in a
pleasant experience where accessing different services throughout the
day "just works".

[^3-2-auth-1]: I'm using the term token colloquially. The actual name
    for this token depends on the underlying technology and may be
    called a *token*, *ticket*, or *assertion*.

Advantages of SSO include centrally managing authorization at the
identity provider and making it easier to implement more sophisticated
credentials, like MFA, because they only need to be implemented by the
identity provider. For many organizations, especially enterprise ones,
SSO is a requirement for any new service.

::: callout-note
The term SSO is somewhat ill-defined. It usually means the experience
described here, but sometimes just means the centralized user and
credential management in an LDAP/AD system.
:::

SSO is analogous to a process where users exchange their credentials for
an access pass upon entering the building. Each room has a machine to
send a request to the central security office, where the room can be
remotely unlocked if the request is approved.

![](images/sso.png){fig-alt="A user getting an SSO token, which they use to login to each service."
width="600"}

SSO isn't a technology. It describes a user and admin experience almost
always accomplished through a standalone identity provider like Okta,
OneLogin, Ping, or Microsoft Entra ID.[^3-2-auth-2] These providers most
often use one of two technologies -- *SAML (Security Assertion Markup
Language)* or *OIDC/OAuth* *(Open Identity
Connect/OAuth2.0)*.[^3-2-auth-3] Your organization's IT/Admins will
likely use OAuth for external SaaS services and may prefer SAML for
services inside your organization's firewall. The experience of using
either is very similar as a user.

[^3-2-auth-2]: Until recently, Microsoft Entra ID was called Azure
    Active Directory, which confusingly was for SSO, not Active
    Directory. That's probably why they changed the name.

[^3-2-auth-3]: OIDC is an authentication standard based on the much
    broader OAuth authorization standard. As a user, you'll never know
    the difference.

    There is a technology called *Kerberos* that some organizations use
    to accomplish SSO with LDAP/AD, though this is rare.

As I write this in 2023, there's a transition underway from on-prem
systems like LDAP/AD to cloud-friendly SSO systems and the enhanced
security they enable. In particular, the use of non-password credentials
like passkeys and the use of OAuth to do sophisticated authorization
management inside enterprises are now cutting-edge, but will be standard
practices within a few years.

## Connecting to data sources

Whether you're working directly on a data science workbench or deploying
a project to a hosting platform, you're almost certainly connecting to a
database, storage bucket, or data API along the way.

It used to be the case that most data sources had simple username and
password auth, so you could authenticate by just passing those
credentials along to the data source, preferably via environment
variables (see [Chapter @sec-data-access]). This is still the easiest
way to connect to data sources.

Organizations are increasingly turning to modern technologies, like
OAuth and IAM, to secure access to data sources, including databases,
APIs, and cloud services. Sometimes you'll have to manually navigate the
token exchange process in your Python or R code. For example, you've
likely acquired and dispatched an OAuth token to access a Google Sheet
or a modern data API.

Increasingly, IT/Admins want users to have the experience of logging in
and automatically accessing data sources. This situation is sometimes
termed *passthrough auth* or *identity federation*. This is a great user
experience and is highly secure because there are never any credentials
in the data science environment, only secure cryptographic tokens.

However, this experience is more complicated than it appears. From what
we've discussed so far, it seems like you could use the SSO token that
got you into the data science environment to access the data source. But
that doesn't work. Instead, each service has its own token that can't be
transformed into one for a different service for security reasons. That
means "passthrough" is a misnomer, and a much more complicated exchange
occurs.

![](images/passthrough_auth.png){fig-alt="The user logs into the data science platform with an SSO token and then can automatically access the data source with the proper token."
width="600"}

OAuth and IAM are quickly becoming industry standards for accessing data
sources, but automated handoffs for every combination of SSO technology,
data science platform, and service token aren't fully implemented. I
expect broader adoption in the next few years. For now, you'll need to
talk to your IT/Admin team about whether there's an integration to
access a data source seamlessly when you log in or if you'll have to
continue using a username and password for a little longer.

Another technology you may encounter when accessing data sources is an
old, but very secure, technology called *Kerberos* that uses a *Kerberos
Ticket* to connect to databases and file shares. Kerberos is most often
used in on-prem Windows environments with LDAP/AD.

## Managing permissions

Irrespective of the technology used, your organization will have
policies about managing permissions that you must incorporate or adopt.

There are meaningful differences in how LDAP, SAML, and OAuth
communicate to services about permissions. That's a level of detail
beyond this chapter -- more in [Appendix @sec-append-auth] if you're
interested.

If your organization has a policy that you're going to need to be able
to enforce inside the data science environment, it's most likely a *Role
Based Access Control (RBAC)* policy. In RBAC, permissions are assigned
to an abstraction called a role. Users and groups are then given roles
depending on their needs.

For example, there might be a `manager` role that should have access to
specific permissions in the HR software. This role would be applied to
anyone in the `data-science-manager` group as well as the
`data-engineering-manager` group.

There are a few issues with RBAC. Most importantly, if there are many
idiosyncratic permissions, creating tons of special roles is often
simpler than figuring out how to harmonize them into a system.

Many organizations haven't reached the complexity of adopting RBAC. They
often use simple *Access Control Lists (ACLs)* of who can access each
service.[^3-2-auth-4] ACLs have the advantage of being conceptually
simple, but maintaining individual lists for each service is a lot of
work with many services and users.

[^3-2-auth-4]: Standard Linux permissions (POSIX permissons) that were
    discussed in [Chapter @sec-linux] are a special case of ACLs. ACLs
    allow setting individual-level permissions for any number of users
    and groups, as opposed to the one owner, one group, and everyone
    else permissions set for POSIX.

    Linux distros now have support for ACLs on top of the standard POSIX
    permissions.

Some organizations are moving towards even more granular techniques than
RBAC and are adopting *Attribute Based Access Control (ABAC)*. In ABAC,
permissions are granted based on an interaction of user-level and
object-level attributes and a rules engine.

For example, you can imagine three distinct attributes a user could
have: `data-science`, `data-engineer`, and `manager`. You could create a
rules engine that provides access to different resources based on the
combinations of these attributes.

Relative to RBAC, ABAC is a more robust system that allows for more
granular permissions, but it's a much bigger lift to configure
initially. You've already encountered an ABAC system in the AWS IAM
system. You were probably completely befuddled if you tried to configure
anything in IAM. You can thank the power and complexity of ABAC.
