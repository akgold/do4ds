# Demystifying \index{Docker} {#sec-docker}

\index{Docker} is an open-source tool for building, sharing, and running
software. \index{Docker} is currently the dominant way software developers
capture a development environment and is an increasingly popular tool to
take code to production.

\index{Docker} has become so popular because it makes code portable. In most
cases, the only system prerequisite to run almost any \index{Docker} \index{Container}
is \index{Docker} itself.[^1-6-docker-1] Everything else comes in the \index{container}.

[^1-6-docker-1]: This was truer before the introduction of M-series
    chips for Macs. Chip architecture differences fall below the level
    that a \index{container} captures and many popular containers wouldn't run
    on new Macs. These issues are getting better over time and will
    probably fully disappear relatively soon.

Unlike language-specific environment as code tools like `{renv}` or
`{venv}`, \index{Docker} captures the entire reproducibility stack down to the
operating system. The appeal is evident if you've ever struggled with
someone else running code you've written.

\index{Docker} has so many strengths that it's easy to believe it will solve all
reproducibility problems. It's worth keeping a little perspective.

While \index{Docker} usually ensures that the code inside will **run**, it
doesn't fully solve reproducibility or IT/Admin concerns. Some highly
regulated contexts consider a \index{container} insufficiently rigorous for
reproducibility purposes.

Running a \index{container} also makes it easy to stand things up, but
integrations to other services, like data sources and authentication,
still must be configured externally.

Lastly, running a \index{container} adds one more services between you and the
code you're trying to run. Trying to get docker to work without a good
mental model of how the services interact can be very frustrating.

::: callout-note
This chapter focuses solely on the local use of \index{Docker} for building and
running containers. For more on running containers in a production
context, including using Kubernetes, see [Chapter @sec-ent-scale].
:::

In this chapter, I aim to provide a little familiarity with the basic
terminology and concepts for running other people's \index{Docker} containers
and creating your own. In the lab at the end of the chapter, we'll
practice hosting an \index{API} inside a \index{container}.

## \index{Container} lifecycle

\index{Docker} is primarily concerned with the creation, movement, and running
of *containers*. A \index{container} is a software entity that packages code and
its dependencies down to the operating system. Containers are one way to
have completely different environments coexisting side by side on one
physical machine.

::: callout-note
Containers aren't the only way to run multiple virtual environments on
one host. They're just the most talked about right now.

And \index{Docker} Containers aren't the only type of \index{container}. You may run
across other kinds, like Apptainer (formerly Singularity), often used in
*high performance computing (HPC)* contexts.
:::

A *\index{Docker} Image* is an immutable snapshot of a \index{container}. When you want
to run a \index{container}, you *pull* the image and run it as an *instance* or
*\index{container}* that you'll interact with.

::: callout-note
Confusingly, the term \index{container} is used both to refer to a running
instance ("Here's my running \index{container}") as well as which image ("I used
the newest Ubuntu \index{container}").

I prefer the term instance for the running \index{container} to eliminate this
confusion.
:::

Images are usually stored in *registries*, which are similar to Git
repositories. The most common registry for public containers is \index{Docker}
Hub, which allows public and private hosting of images in free and paid
tiers. \index{Docker} Hub includes official images for operating systems and
programming languages, as well as many community-contributed containers.
Some organizations run private registries, usually using *registry as a
service* offerings from cloud providers.[^1-6-docker-2]

[^1-6-docker-2]: The big three \index{container} registries are AWS Elastic
    \index{Container} Registry (ECR), Azure \index{Container} Registry, and Google
    \index{Container} Registry.

Images are built from *Dockerfiles* -- the code that defines the image.
Dockerfiles are usually stored in a git repository. Building and pushing
images in a CI/CD pipeline is common so changes to the Dockerfile are
immediately reflected in the registry.

You can control \index{Docker} Containers from the \index{Docker} Desktop app. If you're
using \index{Docker} on a server, you'll mostly interact via the command line
interface (CLI). All \index{Docker} CLI commands are formatted as
`docker <command>`.

The graphic below shows the different states for a \index{container} and the CLI
commands to move from one to another.

![](images/docker-lifecycle.png){fig-alt="A diagram. A dockerfile turns into a \index{Docker} Image with docker build. The image can push or pull to or from an image registry. The image can run as a \index{container} instance."
}

::: callout-note
I've included `docker pull` on the graphic for completeness, but you'll
rarely run it. `docker run` auto-pulls the \index{container}(s) it needs.
:::

Instances run on an underlying machine called a *host*. A primary
feature -- also a liability -- of using containers is that they are
ephemeral. Unless configured otherwise, anything inside an instance when
it shuts down vanishes without a trace.

See [Appendix @sec-append-cheat] for a cheatsheet listing common \index{Docker}
commands.

### Image Names

You must know which image you're referencing to build, push, pull, or
run it. Every image has a name that consists of an *id* and a *tag*.

::: callout-note
If you're using \index{Docker} Hub, \index{container} IDs take the form
`<user>/<\index{container} name>`, so I might have the \index{container}
`alexkgold/my-\index{container}`. This should look familiar to GitHub users.

Other registries may enforce similar conventions for IDs, or they may
allow IDs in any format they want.
:::

Tags specify versions and variants of containers and come after the `id`
and `:`. For example, the official Python \index{Docker} image has tags for each
version of Python like `python:3`, variants for different operating
systems, and a `slim` version that saves space by excluding recommended
packages.

Some tags, usually used for versions, are immutable. For example, the
`rocker/r-ver` \index{container} is built on Ubuntu and has a version of R
built-in. There's a `rocker/r-ver:4.3.1`, which is a \index{container} with R
4.3.1.

Other tags are relative to the point in time. If you don't see a tag on
a \index{container} name, it's using the default `latest`. Other common relative
tags refer to the current development state of the software inside, like
`devel`, `release`, or `stable`.

## Running Containers

The `docker run` command runs \index{container} images as an instance. You can
run `docker run <image name>` to get a running \index{container}. However, most
things you want to do with your instance require several command line
flags.

The `-name <name>` flag names an instance. If you don't provide a name,
each instance gets a random alphanumeric ID on start. Names are useful
because they persist across individual instances of a \index{container}, so they
can be easily remembered or used in code.

The `-rm` flag automatically removes the \index{container} after it's done. If
you don't use the `-rm` flag, the \index{container} will stick around until you
clean it up manually with `docker rm`. The `-rm` flag can be useful when
iterating quickly -- especially because you can't re-use names until you
remove the \index{container}.

The `-d` flag will run your \index{container} in detached mode. This is useful
when you want your \index{container} to run in the background and not block your
terminal session. It's useful when running containers in production, but
you probably don't want to use it when trying things out and want to see
logs streaming out as the \index{container} runs.

### Getting information in and out

When a \index{container} runs, it is isolated from the host. This is a great
feature. It means programs running inside the \index{container} can address the
\index{container}'s filesystem and networking without worrying about the host
outside. But it also means that using resources on the host requires
explicit declarations as part of the `docker run` command.

To get data in or out of a \index{container}, you must mount a shared *volume*
(directory) between the \index{container} and host with the `-v` flag. You
specify a host directory and a \index{container} directory separated by `:`.
Anything in the volume will be available to both the host and the
\index{container} at the file paths specified.

For example, maybe you've got a \index{container} that runs a job against data
it expects in the `/data` directory. On your host machine, this data
lives at `/home/alex/data`. You could make this happen with

``` {.bash filename="Terminal"}
docker run -v /home/alex/data:/data
```

Here's a diagram of how this works.

![](images/docker-on-host.png){fig-alt="A diagram showing how the flag -v /home/data:/data mounts the /home/data directory of the host to /data in the \index{container}."}

Similarly, if you have a service running in a \index{container} on a particular
port, you'll need to map the \index{container} port to a host port with the `-p`
flag.

### Other runtime commands

If you want to see your containers, `docker ps` lists them. This is
especially useful to get instance IDs if you didn't bother with names.

To stop a running \index{container} `docker stop` does so nicely and
`docker kill` terminates a \index{container} immediately.

You can view the logs from a \index{container} with `docker logs`.

Lastly, you can execute a command inside a running \index{container} with
`docker exec`. This is most commonly used to access the command line
inside the \index{container} as if SSH-ing to a server with
`docker exec -it <\index{container}> /bin/bash`.

While it's normal to SSH into a server to poke around, it's somewhat of
an anti-pattern to `exec` in to fix problems. Generally, you should
prefer to review logs and adjust Dockerfiles and `run` commands.

## Building Images from Dockerfiles

A Dockerfile is a set of instructions to build a \index{Docker} image. If you
know how to accomplish something from the command line, you shouldn't
have too much trouble building a Dockerfile to do the same.

One thing to consider when creating Dockerfiles is that the resulting
image is immutable, meaning that anything you build into the image is
forever frozen in time. You'll want to set up the versions of R and
Python and install system requirements in your Dockerfile. Depending on
the purpose of your \index{container}, you may want to copy in code, data,
and/or R and Python packages, or you may want to mount those in from a
volume at runtime.

There are many Dockerfile commands. You can review them all in the
Dockerfile documentation, but here are the handful that are enough to
build most images.

-   `FROM` -- specify the base image, usually the first line of the
    Dockerfile.

-   `RUN` -- run any command as if you were sitting at the command line
    inside the \index{container}.

-   `COPY` -- copy a file from the host filesystem into the \index{container}.

-   `CMD` - Specify what command to run on the \index{container}'s shell when it
    runs, usually the last line of the Dockerfile.[^1-6-docker-3]

[^1-6-docker-3]: You may also see `ENTRYPOINT`, which sets the command
    `CMD` runs against. Usually the default `/bin/sh -c` to run `CMD` in
    the shell will be the right choice.

Every Dockerfile command defines a new *layer*. A great feature of
\index{Docker} is that it only rebuilds the layers it needs to when you make
changes. For example, take the following Dockerfile:

``` {.dockerfile filename="Dockerfile"}
FROM ubuntu:latest

COPY my-data.csv /data/data.csv

RUN ["head", "/data/data.csv"]
```

Let's say I wanted to change the `head` command to `tail`. Rebuilding
this \index{container} would be nearly instantaneous because the \index{container} would
only start rebuilding after the `COPY` command.

Once you've created your Dockerfile, you build it into an image using
`docker build -t <image name> <build directory>`. If you don't provide a
tag, the default tag is `latest`.

You can then push the image to DockerHub or another registry using
`docker push <image name>`.

## Comprehension Questions

1.  Draw a mental map of the relationship between the following:
    Dockerfile, \index{Docker} Image, \index{Docker} Registry, \index{Docker} \index{Container}
2.  When would you want to use each of the following flags for
    `docker run`? When wouldn't you?
    -   `-p`, `--name`, `-d`, `--rm`, `-v`
3.  What are the most important Dockerfile commands?

## Lab: Putting an \index{API} in a \index{Container}

Putting an \index{API} into a \index{container} is a popular way to host them. In this
lab, we will put the Penguin Model Prediction \index{API} from [Chapter
@sec-proj-arch] into a \index{container}.

If you've never used \index{Docker} before, start by installing \index{Docker} Desktop
on your computer.

Feel free to write your own Dockerfile to put the \index{API} in a \index{container}. If
you want to make it easy, the `{vetiver}` package, which you'll remember
auto-generated the \index{API} for us, can also auto-generate a Dockerfile. Look
at the package documentation for details.

Once you've generated your Dockerfile, take a look at it. Here's the one
for my model:

``` {.dockerfile filename="Dockerfile"}
# # Generated by the vetiver package; edit with care
# start with python base image
FROM python:3.9

# create directory in \index{container} for vetiver files
WORKDIR /vetiver

# copy  and install requirements
COPY vetiver_requirements.txt /vetiver/requirements.txt

#
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir --upgrade -r /vetiver/requirements.txt

# copy app file
COPY app.py /vetiver/app/app.py

# expose port
EXPOSE 8080

# run vetiver \index{API}
CMD ["uvicorn", "app.app:api", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8080"]
```

This auto-generated Dockerfile is nicely commented so it's easy to
follow.

::: callout-note
This \index{container} follows the best practices from [Chapter @sec-proj-arch].
We'd expect the model to be updated much more frequently than the
\index{container}, so the model **isn't** built into the \index{container}. Instead, the
\index{container} knows how to fetch the model using the `{pins}` package.
:::

Now build the \index{container} using `docker build -t penguin-model .`.

You can run the \index{container} using

``` {.bash filename="Terminal"}
docker run --rm -d \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  --name penguin-model \
  penguin-model
```

If you go to `http://localhost:8080` you'll find that...it doesn't work?
Why? If you run the \index{container} attached (remove the `-d` from the run
command) you'll get some feedback that might be helpful.

In line 15 of the Dockerfile, we copy `app.py` in to the \index{container}.
Let's look at that file to see if we can find any hints.

``` {.python filename="app.py"}
from vetiver import VetiverModel
import vetiver
import pins


b = pins.board_folder('/data/model', allow_pickle_read=True)
v = VetiverModel.from_pin(b, 'penguin_model', version = '20230422T102952Z-cb1f9')

vetiver_api = vetiver.VetiverAPI(v)
api = vetiver_api.app
```

Look at that (very long) line 6. The \index{API} is connecting to a local
directory to pull the model. Is your Spidey-Sense tingling? Something
about \index{container} filesystem vs host filesystem?

That's right: we put our model at `/data/model` on our **host** machine.
But the \index{API} inside the \index{container} is looking for `/data/model` **inside
the \index{container}** -- which doesn't exist!

This is a case where we need to mount a volume into the \index{container} like
so:

``` bash
docker run --rm -d \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  --name penguin-model \
  -v /data/model:/data/model \
  penguin-model
```

Now you should be able to get your model up in no time.

### Lab Extensions

Right now, logs from the \index{API} stay inside the \index{container} instance. But
that means that the logs go away when the \index{container} does. That's bad if
the \index{container} dies because something goes wrong.

How might you ensure the \index{container}'s logs get written somewhere more
permanent?
