# Lab Map {#sec-append-lab}

This chapter aims to clarify the relationship between the assets you'll
make in each portfolio exercise and labs in this book.

| [@sec-scale]: Scaling Server resources             | Resize the server.                                                                                                                                                          |
| [@sec-networking]: Computer Networks               | Add proxy (NGINX) to reach all services from the web.                                                                                                                       |
