# Technical Detail: Auth Technologies {#sec-append-auth}

[Chapter @sec-auth] provided a conceptual understanding of how auth
works and what SSO is. I also briefly mentioned a few technologies used
to do auth, including LDAP/AD, SAML, and OIDC/OAuth2.0. We'll get a
little deeper into them in this appendix chapter.

Having a basic understanding of these technologies can be helpful when
you're talking to IT/Admins about a data science platform. That said,
this topic is beyond the scope of what you **need** to understand, which
is why this is an appendix.

There are two big distinctions between auth technologies. One is between
systems that pass tokens to services and, therefore, can do SSO and
other systems that provide credentials to the service.[^auth-1] The
other is between modern systems that are designed to work with cloud
services and legacy systems that were designed for on-prem software.

[^auth-1]: As in [Chapter @sec-auth], I'm using the term token as a
    summary, but Kerberos, SAML, and OAuth all have different names --
    more on that below.

| Auth Technology | Token-Based? | "Modern"? |
|-----------------|--------------|-----------|
| Service-based   | No           | No        |
| Linux Accounts  | No[^auth-2]  | No        |
| LDAP/AD         | No           | No        |
| Kerberos        | Yes          | No        |
| SAML            | Yes          | Yes       |
| OAuth           | Yes          | Yes       |

[^auth-2]: To be precise, possible if integrated with Kerberos, but
    unlikely.

Token-based systems are rising in popularity because they are more
convenient for admins and users and are more secure.

One reason token-based systems are more secure is because of credential
handling. In a non token system, the user provides their credentials
directly to the services, which passes them along to authenticate. This
means you have to trust the service with the credentials. Additionally,
if you wanted to use advanced credentials like MFA, biometrics, or
passkeys, the service itself would have to implement them. Most services
do not, so username and password credentials are the only option.

In contrast, credentials are only ever provided to the trusted identity
provider in a token system. That means only the identity provider needs
to implement advanced credentials and less trust in the service is
required because it never sees user credentials.

Token systems are also more secure because of how sessions expire. No
system requires users to log in every single visit to a service. That's
too demanding. Instead, the system issues a cookie or token that will
let the user back in without re-authenticating.

In a credential system, the service itself issues a *browser cookie*
that allows the user back in without re-authenticating until it expires
and it's time to authenticate again. That's usually a relatively long
time, sometimes multiple days.

In a token system, the token to a service has a much shorter life than
the time to re-authenticate. When the service encounters an expired
token, it checks if the user should have access against the identity
provider. This means that changes to authorization propagate as quickly
as the short-lived service tokens expire. That drastically limits the
risk of a stolen token or someone trying to log back in after they've
been locked out.

## Service-based auth

Many pieces of software come with integrated authentication. When you
use those systems, the service stores encrypted username and password
pairs in its own database. If you're administering a single service,
this is really simple. You just set up individual users on the service.

But once you have multiple services, everything has to be managed
service-by-service. And the system is only as secure as what the service
has implemented. Almost any organization with an IT/Admin group will
prefer not to use service-based auth.

## System (Linux) Accounts

Many pieces of software -- especially data science workbenches -- can
look at the server it's sitting on and authenticate against the user
accounts and groups on the server.

On a Linux server, *Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM)* allow a
service to make use of the Linux host's users and groups. As of this
writing, PAM is the default authentication method for RStudio Server and
JupyterHub.

As the name suggests, PAM includes modules that allow it to authenticate
against different systems. The most common is to authenticate against
the underlying Linux server, but it can also use LDAP/AD (common) or
Kerberos tickets (uncommon).

![](images/auth-pam.png){fig-alt="A visual representation of PAM auth flow as described above.."}

PAM can also be used to do things when users log in. The most common of
these is initializing Kerberos tickets to connect with databases or
connecting with shared drives.

When PAM is used in concert with LDAP/AD, the Linux users are usually
created automatically on the system using *SSSD (System Security
Services Daemon)*. This process is called *joining the domain*.

Though conceptually simple, the syntax of PAM modules is confusing, and
reading, writing, and managing PAM modules is onerous. Additionally, as
more services move to the cloud, there isn't necessarily an underlying
Linux host where identities live and PAM can't be used at all.

## LDAP/AD

For many years, Microsoft's Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)
implementation called Active Directory (AD) was the standard in
enterprise auth. It is increasingly being retired in favor of
token-based systems like SAML and OAuth2.0.

Some services can use LDAP/AD indirectly via PAM, while others may be
directly configured to talk to LDAP/AD.

::: callout-note
LDAP is an application-layer protocol, like HTTP. And like HTTP, there
is an SSL-secured version called LDAPS. Because LDAP is almost always
used only inside a private network, adoption of LDAPS is uneven. The
default port for LDAP is $389$ and for LDAPS it's $636$.
:::

Strictly speaking, LDAP/AD isn't an authentication tool. It's a
hierarchical tree database that is good for storing organizational
entities. Doing authentication with LDAP/AD consists of sending a search
for the provided username/password combination to the LDAP/AD database
using the `ldapsearch` command.

When you configure LDAP/AD in an application, you'll configure a *search
base*, which is the subtree to look for users inside. Additionally, you
may configure LDAP/AD with *bind credentials* of a service account to
authenticate to the LDAP/AD server itself.

![](images/auth-ldap.png){fig-alt="A diagram of the LDAP flow. 1-User provides username and password to service. 2-service sends bind credentials w/ ldapsearch to LDAP server. 3-LDAP server checks credentials. 4-LDAP server returns results to service."}

::: callout-note
Depending on your application and LDAP/AD configuration, it may be
possible to skip the bind credentials look up the user with their own
credentials in *single-bind* mode, as opposed to *double-bind* when
there are bind credentials. Single-bind is inferior and shouldn't be
used unless you can't get bind credentials.
:::

An `ldapsearch` returns the *distinguished name (DN)* of the entity that
you are looking for -- assuming it's found.

Here's what my entry in a corporate LDAP directory might look like this:

```         
cn: Alex Gold
mail: alex.gold@example.com
mail: alex.gold@example.org
department: solutions
mobile: 555-555-5555
objectClass: Person
```

This is helpful information, but you'll note that there's no direct
information about authorization. Instead, you configure the service to
authorize certain users or groups. This is time-consuming and
error-prone, as each service needs to be configured separately.

## Kerberos Tickets {#sec-kerberos}

Kerberos is a relatively old, but very secure, token-based auth
technology for use inside a private network. In Kerberos, encrypted
tokens called *Kerberos tickets* are passed between the servers in the
system. A system that is designed to authenticate against a Kerberos
ticket is called *kerberized*.

Kerberos was widely adopted along with Active Directory, and it's used
almost exclusively in places that are running a lot of Microsoft
products. The most frequent use of Kerberos tickets is to establish
connections to Microsoft databases.

In a Kerberos-based system, users often store their credentials in a
secure *keytab*, which is a file on disk. They can manually initialize a
ticket using the `kinit` command or via a PAM session that automatically
fetches a ticket upon user login.

When a Kerberos session is initialized, the service sends the user's
credentials off to the central *Kerberos Domain Controller (KDC)* and
requests the *Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT)* from the KDC. Like most
token authentication, TGTs have a set expiration period and must be
reacquired when they expire.

When the user wants to access a service, they send the TGT back to the
KDC again along with the service they're trying to access and get a
*session key* (sometimes referred to as a *service ticket*) that allows
access to a particular service.

![](images/auth-kerberos.png){fig-alt="The kerberos flow. 1 - User on server requests TGT from KDC. 2 - TGT granted. 3 - user requests service ticket with TGT from KDC. 4 - Service ticket granted. 5 - user uses service ticket to access service."}

Kerberos is only used inside a corporate network and is tightly linked
to the underlying servers. That makes it very secure. Even if someone
stole a Kerberos ticket, it would be very hard for them to use it.

On the other hand, because Kerberos is so tightly tied to servers, it is
a difficult fit alongside cloud technologies and services.

## Modern systems: OAuth + SAML {#oauth-saml}

Most organizations are now quickly moving toward implementing a modern
token-based authentication system through SAML and/or OAuth2.0.

When you go to log in to a service that uses SAML or OAuth, you are
redirected to the SAML/OAuth identity provider to seek a token that will
let you in. Assuming all goes well, you're granted a token and go back
to the service to do your work.

Both OAuth and SAML rely on plain HTTP traffic, making them easier to
configure than LDAP/AD or Kerberos from a networking standpoint.

### SAML

The current SAML 2.0 standard was finalized in 2005, roughly coinciding
with the beginning of the web's modern era, with Facebook launching just
the prior year.

SAML was invented to be a successor to enterprise auth methods like
LDAP/AD and Kerberos. SAML uses encrypted and cryptographically signed
XML tokens that are generated through a browser redirect flow.

In SAML, the service you're accessing is called the *service provider*
(SP) and the entity issuing the token is the SAML *identity provider*
(IdP). Most SAML tooling allows you start at either the IdP or the SP.

If you start at the SP, you'll get redirected to the IdP. The IdP will
verify your credentials. If the credentials are valid, the IdP will put
a SAML token in your browser, which the SP will use to authenticate
you.[^auth-3]

[^auth-3]: The diagram assumes you don't already have a token in your
    browser. If the user has a token already, steps 2-5 get skipped.

![](images/auth-saml.png){fig-alt="A visual representation of SAML auth flow as described above."}

A SAML token contains several *claims*, which usually include a username
and may include groups or other attributes. Whoever controls the IdP can
configure what claims appear on the token at the IdP. The SAML standard
itself is for authentication, not authorization, but it's very common
for an application to have required or optional claims that it can
interpret to do authorization.

### OAuth

OAuth was started in 2006 and the current 2.0 standard was finalized in
2013. OAuth 2.1 is under development as of 2023.

OAuth was designed to be used with different services across the web
from the beginning. Any time you've used a *Log in with
Google/Facebook/Twitter/GitHub* flow -- that's OAuth.

OAuth relies on passing around cryptographically signed JSON Web Tokens
(JWTs). This makes OAuth more straightforward to debug than SAML because
the JWT is plain-text JSON with a signature that proves it's valid.

Unlike a SAML token that always lives in a browser cache, JWTs can go
anywhere. They can live in the browser cache, but they also can pass
from one server to another to do authorization or can be saved in a
user's home directory. For example, if you've accessed Google Sheets or
another Google service from R or Python, you may have manually handled
the resulting OAuth token in your home directory.

OAuth is an authorization scheme, so the contents of a JWT are about the
permissions of the bearer of the token. A related standard called
*OpenID Connect (OIDC)* can be used to do authentication with OAuth
tokens. Over the next few years, I fully expect all data access to move
toward using OAuth tokens.

In OAuth, the service you're trying to visit is called the *resource
server* and the token issuer is the *authorization server*. When you try
to access a service, the service knows to look for a JWT that includes
specific *claims* against a set of *scopes*. If you don't have a JWT,
you must seek it from the authorization server.

For example, if you want to read my Google Calendar, you need a JWT that
includes a claim granting *read* access against the scope of *events on
Alex's calendar*.

![](images/auth-oauth.png){fig-alt="A visual representation of OAuth flow as described above."}

Unlike in SAML where action occurs via browser redirects, OAuth makes no
assumptions about how this flow happens. The process of requesting and
getting a token can happen in several different ways, including browser
redirects and caches, but could be done entirely in R or Python.

## User Provisioning

When you're using a service, users often need to be created
(*provisioned*) in that system. Sometimes, the users will be provisioned
the first time they log in. In other cases, you may want the ability to
provision them beforehand.

LDAP/AD is very good for user provisioning. You can often configure your
application to provision everyone who comes back from a particular
`ldapsearch`. In contrast, token-based systems don't know anything about
you until you show up for the first time with a valid token.

There is a SAML-based provisioning system called *SCIM (System for
Cross-Domain Identity Management)* that is slowly being adopted by many
IdPs and SPs.
