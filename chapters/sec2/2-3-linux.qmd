# Linux Administration {#sec-linux}

You're accustomed to interacting with a computer and phone running
MacOS, Windows, iOS, or Android. But, most servers don't run any of
those.

*Linux* is the world's predominant \index{operating system}*operating
system* (OS) outside of personal computers and phones. Almost all of the
world's embedded computers run Linux -- in ATMs, cars, planes, TVs,
smart thermostats, and most other gadgets and gizmos. Android is a
version of Linux, as is ChromeOS. Almost all of the world's
supercomputers run Linux.

Most importantly for our purposes, most of the world's servers run
on Linux.[^2-3-linux-1]

[^2-3-linux-1]: The remainder are mostly Windows servers. There are a
    few rarer OSes you might encounter, like Oracle Solaris. There is a
    product called *Mac Server*, but it's just a program for managing
    Mac desktops and iOS devices, not a server OS. There are also versions on Linux that run on desktop computers.
    Despite the best efforts of many hopeful nerds, desktop Linux is
    pretty much only used by professional computer people.

To administer a server, you'll have to learn a little about Linux. In
this chapter, you'll learn about the history of Linux and how to
navigate and manipulate a server running Linux. Many of these techniques are also useful on your laptop's command line.

## A brief history of Linux

A computer's OS defines how applications can interact with the
underlying hardware. The OS dictates how files are stored and accessed, how
applications are installed, how network connections work, and more.

Before the early 1970s, the computer hardware and software market looked
nothing like today. Computers of that era had extremely tight linkages
between hardware and software. There was no Microsoft Word you could use
on a machine from Dell, HP, or Apple.

Instead, every hardware company was also a software company. If Example
Corp's computer did text editing, it was because Example Corp had
written (or commissioned) text editing software specifically for their
machine. If Example Corp's machine could run a game, Example Corp had
written that game just for their computer.

Then, in the early 1970s, researchers funded by AT&T's Bell Labs
released *Unix* -- the first \index{operating system}operating system.
Now, there was a piece of middleware that reduced the need for
coordination between computer manufacturers and software developers.
Computer manufacturers could design computers that ran Unix, and
developers could write software that ran on Unix.

The one issue (for everyone but Bell Labs) was that they were paying
Bell Labs a lot of money for Unix licenses. So, in the 1980s,
programmers started writing Unix-like OSs. These so-called *Unix
clones* behaved like Unix but didn't include any actual Unix
code.[^2-3-linux-2]

[^2-3-linux-2]: Or at least they weren't supposed to. There's an
    interesting history of lawsuits, especially around whether the BSD
    OS illegally included Unix code.

In 1991, Linus Torvalds -- then a 21-year-old Finnish grad student --
released an open-source Unix clone called Linux via a nonchalant
newsgroup posting, saying, "I'm doing a (free)
\index{operating system}operating system (just a hobby, won't be big and
professional like gnu)...Any suggestions are welcome, but I won't
promise I'll implement them :-)."[^2-3-linux-3]

[^2-3-linux-3]: Quote from the [History of Linux Wikipedia
    article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Linux). Pedants will scream that the original release of Linux was just the
    \index{operating system}operating system *kernel*, not a full
    \index{operating system}operating system like Unix. Duly noted, now
    go away.

The Linux project outgrew that modest newsgroup post. There are over 600
*distros* (short for distributions) of Linux, which differ by technical
attributes and licensing model. The number of distros reflects the
natural fragmentation of popular open-source projects and the disparate
requirements for systems as varied as your car's infotainment system, a
smartphone, and the controller for your smart thermostat.

Luckily, you don't have to know hundreds of distros. Most organizations
use one of only a handful on their servers. The most common open-source
distros are Ubuntu or CentOS. Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) is the
most common paid distro.[^2-3-linux-4] Many organizations on AWS are
using Amazon Linux, which is independently maintained by Amazon but was
originally a RHEL derivative.[^2-3-linux-5]

[^2-3-linux-4]: RHEL and CentOS are related
    \index{operating system}operating systems, but that relationship has
    changed a lot in the last few years. The details are somewhat
    complicated, but most people expect less adoption of CentOS in
    enterprise settings going forward.

[^2-3-linux-5]: As of early 2024, Amazon Linux 2 is predominant, but
    Amazon Linux 2023 (AL2023) is rising in popularity.

Most people, including me, prefer Ubuntu when they have a choice. It's a
little simpler and easier to configure than the others.

::: callout-note
### Ubuntu Versioning

[Ubuntu versions](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Releases) are numbered by the
year and month they were released. Most people use the Long Term Support
(LTS) releases, released in April of even years.

Ubuntu versions have fun alliterative names, so you'll hear people refer
to releases by name or version. As of this writing, most Ubuntu machines
run Focal (20.04, Focal Fossa), Jammy (22.04, Jammy Jellyfish), or Noble (24.04, Noble Numbat).

## Administering Linux with bash

Linux is administered from the command line using bash or a bash
alternative like zsh. The philosophy behind bash and its derivatives
says that you should be able to accomplish anything you want with small
programs invoked via a *command*. Each command should do just one thing,
and complicated things should be performed by *composing* commands --
taking the output from one as the input to the next.

Invoking a command is done by typing the command on the command line and
hitting `enter`. If you ever find yourself stuck in a situation you
can't seem to exit, `ctrl + c` will quit in most cases.

Helpfully, most bash commands are an abbreviation of the word for what
the command does. Unhelpfully, the letters often seem somewhat random.

For example, the command to *list* the contents of a directory is `ls`,
which mostly makes sense. Over time, you'll get very comfortable with
the commands you use frequently.

Bash commands can be modified to behave the way you need them to.

*Command arguments* provide details to the command. They come after the
command with a space in between. For example, if I want to run `ls` on
the directory `/home/alex`, I can run `ls /home/alex` on the command
line.

Some commands have default arguments. For example, the default argument
for the `ls` command is the current directory. So if I'm in
`/home/alex`, I'd get the same thing from either `ls` or
`ls /home/alex`.

*Options* or *flags* modify the command's operation and come between the
command and arguments. Flags are denoted by having one or more dashes
before them. For example, `ls` allows the `-l` flag, which displays the
output as a list. So, `ls -l /home/alex` would get the files in
`/home/alex` as a list.

Some flags themselves have *flag arguments*. For example, the `-D` flag
allows you to specify how the datetime from `ls -l` is displayed. So
running `ls -l -D %Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S /home/alex` lists all the files in
`/home/alex` with the date-time of the last update formatted in
*ISO-8601* format, which is always the correct format for dates.

Bash commands are always formatted as
`<command> <flags + flag args> <command args>`.

It's nice that this structure is standard. It's not nice that the main
argument is at the end because it makes long bash commands hard to read.
To make commands more readable, you can break the command over multiple
lines and include one flag or argument per line. You can tell bash you
want it to continue a command after a line break by ending the line with
a space and a `\`.

For example, here's that long `ls` command more nicely formatted:

``` {.bash filename="Terminal"}
> ls -l \
   -D %Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S \
   /home/alex
```

All flags and command arguments are found on the program's *man page*
(short for manual). You can access the man page for any command with
`man <command>`. You can scroll the man page with arrow keys and exit
with `q`.

Bash is a fully functional programming language, so that you can assign
variables with `<var-name>=<value>` (no spaces allowed) and access them
`$<var-name>`. The bash version of `print` is `echo`.

For example, a classic "Hello World!" in bash looks like:

``` {.bash filename="Terminal"}
> MSG="Hello World!"
> echo $MSG
Hello World!
```

For the most part, you'll write commands directly on the command line.
You also can write and run bash scripts that include conditionals,
loops, and functions. Bash scripts usually end in `.sh` and are often
run with the `sh` command like `sh my-script.sh`.

The advantage of writing bash scripts is that they can run basically
anywhere. The disadvantage of writing bash scripts is that bash is a
truly ugly programming language that is hard to debug.

## Programs run on behalf of users

Whenever a program is running, it is running as a particular user
identified by their *username*.

On any Unix-like system, the `whoami` command returns the username of
the active user. For example, running `whoami` might look like: 

``` {.bash filename="Terminal"}
> whoami                                                  
alexkgold
```

Usernames have to be unique on the system -- but they're not the true
identifier for a user. A user is uniquely identified by their *user ID*
(`uid`), which maps to all the other user attributes like username,
password, home directory, groups, and more. The `uid` for a user is
assigned when the user is created and usually doesn't need to be changed
or specified manually.[^2-3-linux-6]

[^2-3-linux-6]: The one exception to this is when you've got the same
    user accessing resources across multiple machines. Then the `uid`s
    have to match. If you're worrying about this kind of thing, it's
    probably time to bring in a professional IT/Admin.

Each human who accesses a Linux server should have their own account. In
addition, many applications create *service account* users for
themselves and run as those users. For example, installing
\index{RStudio}RStudio Server will create a user with username `rstudio-server`. Then, when
\index{RStudio}RStudio Server goes to do something -- start an `R`
session, for example -- it will do so as `rstudio-server`.

User `uid`s start at 10,000 with those below 10,000 reserved for system
processes. There's also one special user -- the admin, root, sudo, or
superuser who gets the special `uid` 0.

Users belong to *groups*, which are collections of one or more users.
Each user has exactly one *primary* *group* and can be a member of
secondary groups. By default, each user's primary group is the same as
their username.

Like a user has a `uid`, a group has a `gid`. User `gid`s start at 100.

The `id` command shows a user's username, `uid`, groups, and `gid`. For example, I might be a member of several groups, with the primary group
`staff`.

``` {.bash filename="Terminal"}
> id
uid=501(alexkgold) gid=20(staff) groups=20(staff),
12(everyone), ...
```

If you ever need to add users to a server, the easiest way is with the
`useradd` command. Once you have a user, you may need to change the
password, which you can do at any time with the `passwd` command. Both
`useradd` and `passwd` start interactive prompts, so you don't need to
do more than run those commands.

If you ever need to alter a user -- the most common task is adding a
user to a group -- you would use the `usermod` command with the `-aG`
flag.

## Permissions dictate what users can do

In Linux, everything you can interact with is just a file. Every log --
file. Every picture -- file. Every application -- file. Every
configuration -- file.

So whether a user can take an action is determined by whether they have
the proper permissions on a particular file.

Basic Linux permissions (*POSIX permissions*) consist of a $3*3$ matrix of
read, write, and execute for the owner, owning group, and everyone
else. Read means the user can see the contents of a file, write means
the user can save a changed version, and execute means they can run the
file as a program.

::: callout-note
There are more complex ways to manage Linux permissions. For example,
you might hear about Access Control Lists (ACLs). They're beyond the
scope of this book.

There is more information on how organizations manage users and what
they can do in [Chapter @sec-auth], which is all about auth.
:::

For example, here's a set of permissions that you might have for a
program that you want anyone to be able to run, group members to
inspect, and only the owner to change.

![](./images/perms-ex.png){.lightbox
fig-alt="A 3x3 grid read, write, execute, on one side and owner, owning group, and everyone else at the top. Green checks in all of the execute, write for the owner, and read for owner and owning group. Red xs everywhere else."}

Directories also have permissions -- read allows the user to see what's
in the directory, write allows the user to alter what's in the
directory, and execute allows the user to enter the directory.

File permissions and directory permissions don't have to match. For
example, a user could have read permissions on a directory to see the
names of the files, but not have read permissions on any of the files so
they can't look at the contents.

When you're working on the command line, you don't get a little grid of
permissions. Instead, they're expressed in one of two ways. The first is
the string representation, a 10-character string that looks like
`-rw-r–r--`.

The first character indicates the type of file: most often `-` for
normal (file) or `d` for a directory.

The following nine characters indicate the three permissions for the
user, the group, and everyone else. There will be an `r` for read, a `w`
for write, and an `x` for execute or `-` to indicate that they don't
have the permission.

So the permissions in the graphic would be `-rwxr-x--x` for a file and
`drwxr-x--x` for a directory.

The best way to get these permissions is to run the `ls -l` command. For example:

``` {.bash filename="Terminal"}
> ls -l
-rw-r--r--  1 alexkgold  staff     28 Oct 30 11:05 config.py
-rw-r--r--  1 alexkgold  staff   2330 May  8  2017 credentials.json
-rw-r--r--  1 alexkgold  staff   1083 May  8  2017 main.py
drwxr-xr-x 33 alexkgold  staff   1056 May 24 13:08 tests
```

Each line starts with the string representation of the permissions
followed by the owner and group so you can easily understand who should
be able to access that file or directory.

All of the files in this directory are owned by `alexkgold`. Only the
owner (`alexkgold`) has write permission, but everyone has read
permission. In addition, there's a `tests` directory, with read and
execute for everyone and write only for `alexkgold`.

You will probably need to change a file's permissions when administering
a server. You can do so using the `chmod` command.

For `chmod`, permissions are indicated as a three-digit number, like
`600`, where the first digit is the permission for the user, the second
for the group, and the third for everyone else. To get the right number,
you sum the permissions as follows: 4 for read, 2 for write, and 1 for
execute. You can check for yourself that any set of permissions is
uniquely identified by a number between 1 and 7.[^2-3-linux-7]

[^2-3-linux-7]: Clever eyes may realize that this is just the base-10
    representation of a three-digit binary number.

So to implement the permissions from the graphic, you'd want the
permission set `751` to give the user full permissions (4 + 2 + 1), read
and execute (4 + 1) to the group, and execute only (1) to everyone else.

::: callout-note
If you spend any time administering a Linux server, you will almost
certainly find yourself applying `chmod 777` to a directory or file to
rule out a permissions issue.

I can't tell you not to do this -- we've all been there. But, if it's
something important, change it back once you've figured things out.
:::

You might want to change a file's owner or group. You can change users
and groups with the `chown` command. Users get changed with a username,
and groups can be changed with the group name prefixed by a colon.

Sometimes, you might not be the correct user to take a particular
action. If you want to change your user, you can use the `su` (switch
user) command. You'll be prompted for a password to make sure you're
allowed.

The admin or root user has full permissions on every file, and there are
some actions that only the root user can do. When you need to do
root-only things, you usually don't want to `su` to switch to be the root user.
It's too powerful. And, if you have user-level configuration, it all
gets left behind.

Instead, individual users can be granted the power to temporarily assume
root privileges without changing to be the root user. This is
accomplished by making them members of the admin group. If a user is a
member of the admin group, they can prefix commands with `sudo` to run
those commands with root privileges.

The name of the admin group varies by distro. In Ubuntu, the group is
called `sudo`.

## The Linux filesystem is a tree

All the information available to a computer is indexed by its
*filesystem*, which comprises *directories* or *folders*, which are
containers for other directories and files.

You're probably used to browsing the filesystem with your mouse on your
laptop. Apps completely obscure the filesystem on your phone, but it's
there. On a Linux server, the only way to traverse the filesystem is
with written commands. Therefore, a good mental model for the filesystem
on your server is critical.

In Linux, each computer has precisely one filesystem, based at the *root
directory*, `/`. The rest of the filesystem is a tree (or perhaps an
upside-down tree). Every directory is contained in by a *parent
directory* and may contain one or more *children* or
*sub-directories*.[^2-3-linux-8] A `/` in between two directories means
that it's a sub-directory.

[^2-3-linux-8]: The root directory at the base of the tree, `/`, is its
    own parent.

Every directory is a sub-directory of `/` or a sub-directory of a
sub-directory of `/` or...you get the picture. The `/home/alex` *file
path* defines a particular location, the `alex` sub-directory of
`/home`, itself a sub-directory of the root directory, `/`.

![](images/directories.png){.lightbox
fig-alt="A tree of directories. / is the root, /home is a sub directory, /home/alex is a sub-sub-directory, and /etc is another sub-directory."}

::: callout-tip
It's never necessary, but viewing the tree-like layout for a directory
can sometimes be helpful. The `tree` utility can show you one. It
doesn't always come pre-installed, so you might have to install it.
:::

Because the entire Linux filesystem is based at `/`, it doesn't matter
what physical or virtual disks you have attached to your system. They
will fall somewhere under the main filesystem (often inside `/mnt`), but
the fact that they're on separate drives is obscured from the user.

This will be familiar to MacOS users because MacOS is based on an
\index{operating system}operating system called BSD that, like Linux, is
a Unix clone. If you're familiar with Windows, the Linux filesystem may
seem strange.

In Windows, each physical or logical disk has its own filesystem with
its own root. You're probably familiar with `C:` as your main
filesystem. Your machine may also have a `D:` drive. If you've got
network share drives, they're likely at `M:` or `N:` or `P:`.

Another difference is that Windows uses `\` to separate file path
elements rather than `/`. This used to be a big deal, but newer versions
of Windows accept file paths using `/`.

### Working with File Paths

Whenever a program runs, it runs at a particular path in the filesystem
called the *working directory*. You can get the absolute path to your
working directory with the `pwd` command, an abbreviation for *print
working directory*.

When you want a program to run the same regardless of where it's run
from, it's best to use an *absolute path*, specified relative to the
root. Absolute paths are easy to recognize because they start with `/`.

Sometimes, it's convenient to use a *relative* file path, which starts at
the working directory, denoted by `.`. For example, if I want to access
the `data` subdirectory of the working directory, that would be
available at `./data`.

The working directory's parent is at `..`. You could see everything in
the parent directory of your current working directory with `ls ..` or
its parent with `ls ../..`.

All accounts representing actual humans should have a *home directory*,
which usually live inside `/home`.

The home directory and all its contents are owned by the user to whom it
belongs. The home directory is the user's space to store what they need,
including user-specific configuration. Users can find their home
directory at `~`.

You will need to change your working directory, which you can do with
the `cd` command, short for *change directory*. You can use either
absolute or relative file paths with `cd`. If you were in `/home/alex`
and wanted to navigate to `/home`, either `cd ..` or `cd /home` would
work.

Some files or directories are *hidden* so they don't appear in a normal
`ls`. You know a file or directory is hidden because its name starts
with `.`. Hidden files are usually configuration files you don't
manipulate in normal usage. These aren't secret or protected in any way;
they're just skipped by `ls` for convenience. If you want to display all
files in a directory, including hidden ones, you can use the `-a` flag
(for *all*) with `ls`.

You've already seen a couple of hidden files in this book -- like the
`.github` directory, command line configuration in `.zprezto` and
`.zshrc`, and Python environmental configuration in `.env`. You might
also be familiar with `.gitignore`, `.Rprofile`, and `.Renviron`.

## Moving files and directories

You will frequently need to change where files and directories are on
your system, including copying, deleting, moving, and more.

You can copy a file or directory from one place to another using the
`cp` command. `cp` leaves the old file or directory behind and
duplicates it at the specified location. You can use the `-r` flag to
copy everything in a directory recursively.

You can move a file with the `mv` command, which does not leave the old
file behind. If you want to remove a file entirely, you can use the `rm`
command. The `-r` (recursive) flag can be used with `rm` to remove
everything within a directory and the `-f` (force) flag can skip `rm`
double-checking you really want to do this.

::: callout-warning
Be very careful with the `rm` command, especially with `-rf`.

There's no recycle bin. Things that are deleted are instantly deleted
forever.
:::

If you want to make a directory, `mkdir` makes a file path. It can be
used with relative or absolute file paths and can include multiple
sub-directories. For example, if you're in `/home/alex`, you could
`mkdir project1/data` to make a `project1` directory and `data`
sub-directory.

The `mkdir` command throws an error if you try to create a path that
includes some existing directories -- for example, if `project1` already
existed in the example above. The `-p` flag can be handy to create only
the parts of the path that don't exist.

Sometimes, it's useful to operate on every file inside a directory. You
can get every file that matches a pattern with the wildcard, `*`. You
can also do partial matching with the wildcard to get all the files that
match part of a pattern.

For example, let's say I have a `/data` directory and want to put a
copy of only the `.csv` files inside into a new `data-copy`
sub-directory. I could do the following:

``` {.bash filename="Terminal"}
> mkdir -p /data/data-copy
> cp /data/*.csv /data/data-copy
```

### Moving Things to and from the Server

It's very common to have a file on your server that you want to move to
your desktop or vice versa. There are a few different ways to transfer
files and directories.

If you're moving multiple files, first combining them into a single
object can make things easier. The `tar` command turns a set of files or
a whole directory into a single archive file, usually with the file
suffix `.tar.gz`. Creating an archive also does some compression. The
amount depends on the content.

In my opinion, `tar` is a rare failure of bash to provide standalone
commands for anything you need to do. `tar` is used to create and unpack
(extract) archive files. Telling it which one requires several flags.
You'll basically never use `tar` without a bunch of flags, and the
incantation is hard to remember. I google it every time I use it. The
flags you'll most often use are in the cheat sheet in [Appendix
@sec-append-cheat].

You can move files to or from a server with the `scp` command. `scp`
(short for *secure copy*) is `cp`, but with an \index{SSH}SSH connection
in the middle.[^2-3-linux-9]

[^2-3-linux-9]: It's worth noting that `scp` is now considered "insecure
    and outdated". The ways it is insecure are rather obscure and not
    terribly relevant for most people. But, if you're moving a lot of
    data, then you may want something faster. If so, I'd recommend more
    modern options like `sftp` and `rsync`. This isn't necessary if
    you're only occasionally `scp`-ing small files to or from your
    server.

Since `scp` establishes an \index{SSH}SSH connection, you need to make
the request to somewhere that is accepting \index{SSH}SSH connections.
That means that whether you're copying something to or from a server,
you'll run `scp` from a regular terminal on your laptop, not one already
\index{SSH}SSH-ed into your server.

Regular `ssh` options work with `scp`, like `-i` and `-v`.

## Pipes and redirection

You can always copy and paste command outputs or write them to a file,
but it can also be helpful to just chain a few commands together. Linux
provides a few handy *operators* that you can use to make this easy.

The simplest operator is the *pipe* `|`, which takes the output of one
command and makes it the input for the subsequent command.

For example, you might want to see how many files are in a directory.
The `wc -l` (word count, lines) command counts lines, so you could do
`ls | wc -l` since each file returned by `ls` is counted as a line.

::: callout-note
## Ceci n'est pas une pipe.

The R pipe, `%>%`, operates very much like the Linux pipe. It was first 
introduced in the `{magrittr}` package in 2013 and is a popular part of 
the `{tidyverse}`.[^2-3-linux-10] 

The `{magrittr}` pipe was itself inspired by pipe operators from Unix (Linux) and
the `F#` programming language.

Due to its popularity, the pipe `|>` was formally added to the base R
language in R 4.1 in 2021.
:::

[^2-3-linux-10]: The title of this callout box is also the tagline for
    the `{magrittr}` package.

A few operators write the output of the left-hand side into a file.

The `>` command takes the output of a command on the left and writes it
as a new file. If the file you specify already exists, it will be
overwritten.

If you want to append the new text, rather than overwrite, `>>` appends
to the end of the file. I generally default to `>>`, because it will
create a new file if one doesn't exist, and I usually don't mean to
overwrite what's there.

A common reason you might want to do this is to add something to the end
of your `.gitignore`. For example, if you want to add your `.env` file
to your `.gitignore`, you could do that with
`echo .env >> .gitignore`.[^2-3-linux-11] Another great use is to add a
new public key to your `.ssh/authorized_keys` file.

[^2-3-linux-11]: Note that `echo` is needed so that the `.env` gets
    repeated as a character string. Otherwise `.env` would be treated as
    a command.

Sometimes, you want to create empty files or directories. The `touch`
command makes a blank file at the specified file path. If you `touch` a
preexisting file, it updates the time it was last edited without making
any changes. This can be useful because some applications use the file
timestamp to see if action is needed.

When you use your server's `.pem` key, you log in as the root user, but
that's too much power to acquire regularly. Additionally, since your
server is probably for multiple people, you will want to create users
for them.

In this lab, you'll create a regular user for yourself and add an
\index{SSH}SSH key for them so you can directly log in from your
personal computer.

### Step 1: Create a non-root user

Let's create a user using the `adduser` command. This will walk us
through prompts to create a new user with a home directory and a
password. Feel free to add any information you want -- or to leave it
blank -- when prompted.

I'm going to use the username `test-user`. If you want to be able to
copy/paste commands, I'd advise doing the same. If you were creating
users for actual humans, I'd recommend using their names.

``` {.bash filename="Terminal"}
> adduser test-user
```

We want this new user to be able to adopt root privileges so let's add
them to the `sudo` group with:

``` {.bash filename="Terminal"}
> usermod -aG sudo test-user
```

### Step 2: Add an SSH key for your new user

Let's register an \index{SSH}SSH key for the new user by adding the key
from the last lab to the server user's `authorized_users` file.

First, you must get your public key to the server using scp.

For me, the command looks like this:
``` {.bash filename="Terminal"}
> scp -i ~/Documents/do4ds-lab/do4ds-lab-key.pem \ 
    ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub \
    ubuntu@$SERVER_ADDRESS:/home/ubuntu
```

We're copying the public key, but \index{SSH}SSH access (argument to
`-i`) is still with the server's `.pem` key because there isn't another
one registered yet.
:::

The public key is on the server, but in the `ubuntu` user's home
directory. You'll need to do the following:

1.  Create `.ssh/authorized_keys` in `test-user`'s home directory.

2.  Copy the contents of the public key you uploaded into the
    `authorized_keys` file (recall `>>`).

3.  Ensure the `.ssh` directory and `authorized_keys` files are owned by
    `test-user` with `700` permissions on `.ssh` and `600` on
    `authorized_keys`.

You could do this all as the admin user, but I'd recommend switching to
being `test-user` at some point with the `su` command.

::: callout-tip
If you run into trouble assuming `sudo` with your new user, try exiting
SSH and returning. Sometimes, these changes aren't picked up until you
restart the shell.
:::

Once you've done all this, you should be able to log in from your
personal computer with `ssh test-user@$SERVER_ADDRESS`.

Now that we're all set up, you should store the `.pem` key somewhere
safe and never use it to log in again.
