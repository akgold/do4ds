# Tools of the IT/Admin {#sec-tools}

The last section was all about how to make use of DevOps technologies
*as a data scientist.* The next section introduces a baseline of
IT/Admin knowledge.

This section is the bridge between the two.

This section is designed to get you comfortable with the tools you need
to administer a remote server over SSH if you've never done so before.
This section includes an intro to the terminal and the command line and
how to use SSH to connect to a remote server.

I think of these tools solidly as IT/Admin tools, though I think
facility on the command line can also be useful as a solo data
scientist.

If you're comfortable using SSH on a remote server, it may well be that
this section is skippable for you. I might recommend skimming -- there
might be a useful trick or two in here. If you're not sure, review the
questions at the end of each chapter. If you've got the answers down you
can probably skip the chapter with no issue.
