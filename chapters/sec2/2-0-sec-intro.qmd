# The DIY Data Science Environment {#sec-2-intro}

The first section of this book focused on how to move your data science
practices closer to the DevOps ideal -- and mostly focused on the Dev
side of the coin.

This section focuses more on Ops.

In this section, you'll learn how to manage a server-based data science
environment reasonably safely and securely. We're going to get into how
to make use of Amazon Web Services (AWS) to host data science assets on
the web.

You're going to learn standard patterns to do simple administrative
tasks for servers and apply those to a data science use-case.

But before you get too excited, it's also worth talking about the limits
of this section.

There's a reason IT Administration is a career all to itself. There's so
much to know about servers, networking, managing users, storage, and
more. And it's scary -- it's easy to run into pitfalls that cause
security vulnerabilities, system instability, and general annoyance.

Moreover, hosting servers isn't your competitive advantage as a data
scientist. You're probably great at writing R or Python code, cleaning
and managing data, or building models. Managing servers isn't in your
core skillset.

So this section is really targeting the student who wants to host a
project for portfolio purposes, the hobbyist who's hosting a toy
project, or the data science leader who has no choice but to host things
for themselves because they just can't get IT/Admin support.

The good news is that if that's you, you're in the right place.

This section has five chapters, building towards having a data science
workbench with R and Python in the cloud you could actually use for
yourself or a small team.

In addition to hosting those development environments, we'll also deploy
a Shiny app on the server using Shiny Server Open Source and we'll host
a vetiver-generated API using a Docker container.

So how are we going to get there?

In each of the five chapters, we'll go through a conceptual overview of
an important aspect of acquiring, hosting, and managing a data science
environment in the cloud. Once you've read the conceptual overview,
we'll do a hands-on lab where you'll get to practice actually
accomplishing something in AWS.

Let's get started.
