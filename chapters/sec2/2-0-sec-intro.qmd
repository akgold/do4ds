# IT/Admin Tools {#sec-2-intro}

[Section 1](@sec-1-intro) was all about how to apply DevOps principles
and best practices to your work as a data scientist. [Section
3](@sec-3-intro) will start to introduce you to a baseline of IT/Admin
knowledge.

This section is the bridge between the two.

In this section, you'll learn about the tools that IT/Admins use every
day like the command line, SSH, and Docker. It turns out that these
tools can also be really useful for day-to-day work as a data scientist,
so I'd encourage you to read even if you never plan to do any IT/Admin
work.

As this section is focused on tooling, it's much lighter on conceptual
content than any other section. I'm not really going to explain why you
might use these tools -- just how. You might call it downright boring.

You should at least skim this section so you know what's here. Then,
when we get into Linux and network administration in Section 3 and
you're lost, you'll remember that there's some help to be had here. Even
if you're comfortable SSH-ing into a server and using the command line
and Docker, there might be some useful tricks or details.

## Labs in this Section

There's only one lab in this section in [Chapter @sec-docker] on using
Docker. Docker is a hot enough topic that I felt it was worth spending
some more time on. In this chapter, you'll take the Palmer Penguins mass
prediction API and app and learn how to Docker-ize them.

For more details on what you'll do in each chapter, see [Appendix
@sec-append-lab].
