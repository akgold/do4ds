# You should use SSL/HTTPS {#sec-ssl}

In [Chapter @sec-networking], I used the analogy of putting a letter in
the mail for sending HTTP traffic over the web. But that's actually not
right. HTTP traffic sent in plaintext, which means it's actually like
sending a postcard. Anyone along the way can just look right at what
you're sending. That's bad.

HTTPS is the digital equivalent of putting your HTTP mail inside an
opaque envelope. It doesn't change anything about the application layer
protocol, but it does secure the whole thing.

In this chapter, you'll learn the basics of how HTTPS works. In the lab,
you'll configure your site to use HTTPS so that it can be accessed
securely.

## What HTTPS does

HTTPS is the same as HTTP, but secured with a technology called *SSL/TLS
(secure sockets layer/transport layer security)*. SSL/TLS works by
configuring the resource to provide an *SSL certificate* upon demand,
which is used to verify the site's identity and establish an encrypted
session.

## SSL vs TLS

TLS is actually what's in use these, but you'll mostly talk about SSL.
TLS is the successor to SSL, but the configuration is identical, so most
people didn't update how they talk about it.
:::

You use HTTPS constantly. Go to a website in your browser and look for a
little lock icon near the search bar. That little lock indicates that
the domain is secured using HTTPS. If you click on it, you can get more
information about the site's SSL certificate.

If you're of a certain age, you may recall warnings that you shouldn't
use the WiFi at your neighborhood Starbucks. The issue was twofold.

HTTP has no way to verify that the website you **think** you're
interacting with is actually that website. So a bad actor could put up a
fake WiFi network that makes $\text{bankofamerica.com}$ resolve to a
lookalike website to capture your banking information. That's called a
*man-in-the-middle* attack.

And even if they didn't do that, they could inspect the traffic going
back and forth and just read whatever you're sending over the web in
what's called a *packet sniffing* attack.

In 2015, Google Chrome began the process of marking any site using plain
HTTP as insecure, which led to nearly complete adoption of HTTPS across
the internet. The risk of both of these kinds of attacks has been
neutered and it's actually pretty safe to use any random WiFi network
you want these days -- because of HTTPS.

As a website administrator, securing your website or server with HTTPS
is one of the most basic things you can do to make sure your website
traffic is safe. You should always configure HTTPS for a public website
-- full stop.

It's worth noting that this SSL/TLS security can be applied to a number
of different application layer protocols, including (S)FTP and LDAP(S).
You may run across these depending on your organization. In any case,
the SSL/TLS part works the same and all that changes is what's inside
the secure digital envelope.

## How SSL/TLS works

SSL/TLS uses public key encryption (remember, we learned about that in
[Chapter @sec-cmd-line]) to do two things -- validate that the site
you're visiting is the site you intend and encrypt the traffic back and
forth to the site.

To set up SSL for a website, you create or acquire an SSL certificate,
which has a public and a private component (sound
familiar?).[^2-8-ssl-1] Then, verify the public certificate with a
trusted *Certificate Authority* (CA) and put the private certificate in
the right place on the website.[^2-8-ssl-2]

[^2-8-ssl-1]: Like with SSL, this makes more sense if you think key
    where you see private and lock where you see public.

[^2-8-ssl-2]: The CA verifies the certificate by signing it. Your
    machine just keeps public certificates for the CAs. Then, when it
    gets an SSL certificate that's signed by one of those CAs, it can
    validate that the CA actually stamped this certificate as valid.

Then, when you go to access that resource, the first thing your machine
asks for is a *signature*. The site uses its private key to generate the
signature and your machine verifies the signature against it's internal
trusted *CA store*.

Now your machine knows it's communicating with the right host on the
other side and you're not falling victim to a man-in-the-middle attack.

Once the verification process is done, your machine and the remote on
the other side create temporary *session keys* to establish encryption
with the website on the other end.[^2-8-ssl-3] Only then does it start
sending real data, now encrypted securely inside a digital envelope.

[^2-8-ssl-3]: Unlike the asymmetric encryption used by SSL and SSH for
    the public key encryption, the session keys are symmetric, so they
    work the same in both directions.

## Getting and using SSL certificates

When you buy a computer, it comes configured out of the box to trust a
small number of official CAs. So if you're a website wanting to get a
certificate, you generally want to get it from one of those CAs.

This used to be kinda a pain. The CAs charged to issue certificates.
While it was only \$10 per year to for a basic SSL certificate, they
typically would only cover a single subdomain. A *wildcard* certificate
to cover all the subdomains of a root domain was expensive enough to
discourage hobbyists.

If you wanted a free certificate, your only option was to use a
*self-signed certificate*, which you'd create similarly to creating an
SSH key. This was a pain because you had to manually add the public
certificate to the CA store of every machine that would be accessing the
site, and then re-add it when the certificate expired.[^2-8-ssl-4]

[^2-8-ssl-4]: You also could skip that step, in which case you got the
    session encryption benefits of SSL/TLS, but not the verification.

Luckily there's now another option. For most small organizations, I
recommend getting a free SSL certificate from the nonprofit CA *Let's
Encrypt*. They even have some nice tooling that makes it super easy to
create and configure your certificate right on your server.

For most organizations, using a public CA to get SSL on public-facing
resources is sufficient and use plain HTTP inside private networks. Some
large organizations want to encrypt their private traffic as well and
run their own private CA. If this is the case, your organization's
policies will make it clear. This can be a pain, because you've got to
make sure every host inside the network trusts the private CA.

Once you've configured SSL/TLS, you generally want to **only** allow
HTTPS traffic to your site. You'll accomplish this by redirecting all
HTTP traffic on port $80$ to come in via HTTPS on port $443$.

Some web applications support configuring a certificate directly, while
others only accept HTTP traffic, so you'd need to do *SSL termination*
with a proxy in front of the application.

## Comprehension Questions

1.  What are the two risks of using plain HTTP and how does HTTPS
    mitigate them?
2.  Write down a mental map of how SSL secures your web traffic. Include
    the following: public certificate, private certificate, certificate
    authority, encrypted traffic, port 80, port 443

## Lab: Configure SSL

We're going to use Let's Encrypt's *certbot* utility to automatically
generate an SSL certificate, share it with the CA, install it on the
server, and even update your NGINX configuration.

If you've never had to manually configure SSL in the past, let me tell
you, this is magical!

### Step 1: Follow instructions to add SSL for NGINX

Using Let's Encrypt to add an SSL certificate to NGINX configuration is
a super common task. As of this writing, there's a great blog post
entitled [*Using Free Let's Encrypt SSL/TLS Certificates with
NGINX*](https://www.nginx.com/blog/using-free-ssltls-certificates-from-lets-encrypt-with-nginx/).
I'd encourage you to look for that article (or something similar) and
follow the steps there.

At a high level, what you'll do is

1.  Configure the NGINX configuration to know what domain its on.
2.  Install certbot on the system.
3.  Run certbot to get the certificate, apply it to the server, and
    update the NGINX configuration.

Before you move along, I'd recommend you take a moment and inspect the
`/etc/nginx/nginx.conf` file to look at what certbot added.

Relative to the old version, you'll notice two things. First, the line
that read `listen 80` is gone from the server block because we're no
longer listening for HTTP traffic. In it's place, there's now a
`listen 443` along with a bunch of stuff that tells NGINX where to find
the certificate on the server.

Scrolling down a little, there's a new server block that **is
listening** on $80$. This block returns a `301` status code (permanent
redirect) and sends traffic to HTTPS on $443$.

### Step 2: Let RStudio Server know it's on HTTPS

Before we exit and test it out, let's do one more thing. As mentioned
when we configured NGINX the first time, RStudio Server does a bunch of
proxying traffic back to itself, so it needs to know that it's on HTTPS.

You can let RStudio Server know that it's on HTTPS by adding a header to
all traffic letting RStudio Server know the protocol is HTTPS. You can
add this line to your `nginx.conf`:

``` {.bash filename="/etc/nginx/nginx.conf"}
proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto https;
```

Ok, now try to visit RStudio Server at your URL, and you'll find
that...it's broken again.

Before you read along, think for just a moment. Why is it broken?

### Step 3: Configure security groups

If your thoughts went to something involving ports and AWS security
groups, you're right!

By default, our server was open to SSH traffic on port $22$. Since then,
we may have opened or closed port $80$, $8000$, $8080$, $8787$, and/or
$3838$.

But now that we're exclusively sending HTTPS traffic into the proxy on
$443$ and letting the proxy redirect things elsewhere. So you have to go
into the security group settings and change it so there are only 2 rules
-- one that allows SSH traffic on $22$ and one that allows HTTPS traffic
on $443$.

It's up to you whether you want to leave port $80$ open. If you do, it
will redirect people to HTTPS on $443$. If you close it entirely, people
who come to port $80$ will be blocked and will eventually get a timeout.
If people are used to coming to the server via HTTP, it might be nice to
leave $80$ open so they get a nice redirect experience instead of
getting confusingly blocked.

### Step 4: We did it!

This is the end of the labs in this book.

At this point your server is fully configured. You have three real data
science services available on a domain of your choosing protected by
HTTPS and you can SSH in to do admin work.

Take a moment to celebrate. It's very cool to be able to stand up and
administer your own data science workbench. If you're working at a small
organization or are a hobbyist, you can really use this server to do
real data science work.

But this server isn't enterprise-ready. If you work at a large
organization or one with stringent security or privacy rules, your
IT/Admin group is going to have concerns. Read on to learn more about
what they are and why they're completely valid.
