# Using the command line {#sec-cmd-line}

Interacting with your personal computer or phone happens via taps and
clicks, opening applications, and navigating tabs and windows. But
server operating systems have no *graphical user interface (GUI)* to be
tapped or clicked. On a server, administrative interaction is via the
*command line* -- an all-text interface where you type to indicate what
you want to do.

Even if you're not administering a server, it's worth learning your way
around the command line as many tasks are quicker and easier from there.
Most people who learn the command line often use it on their personal
computers.

::: callout-note
In some organizations, server admin tasks are done via a graphical tool,
but this is a red flag.

It means that the organization is either trying to find relatively
low-paid (and probably low-skilled) admins or are using a graphical tool
to limit what IT/Admins can do. Either way, it's going to be harder to
get things done.
:::

In this chapter, you will learn to set up and customize your machine's
command line and to access a server via *secure socket shell (SSH)* --
the administrative side door on a server.

## Getting the command line you want

As you start on the command line, you'll soon realize that some
customization is in order. Maybe the colors aren't quite right, or you
want shortcuts for commands you often type, or you want more information
in the display.

Some might argue that customizing your command line isn't the best use
of your time and energy. Those people are no fun. A command line that
behaves exactly as you like will speed up your work and make you feel
like a hacker.

But as you get started, you'll soon find yourself neck-deep in Stack
Overflow posts on how to customize your `.bashrc`. Or wait, is it the
`.zshrc`? Or...

The command line you interact with is two or three programs that sit on
top of each other. You can mix and match options and configure each in
various ways, which makes customization a little confusing.

### Notes on operating systems

Because I've been using the command line in MacOS for many years, I have
strong opinions to share in this chapter.

I haven't used a Windows machine in a while. I've collected some
recommendations, but I can't personally vouch for them the same way.

I don't include Linux recommendations because people who use Linux on
their desktops have already gone deep down the customization rabbit hole
and don't need my help wasting their time.
:::

## The terminal

The *terminal* is the GUI where you'll type in commands. Your terminal
program will dictate the colors and themes available for the window, how
tabs and panes work, and the keyboard shortcuts you'll use to manage
them.

Some *integrated development environments (IDEs)*, like RStudio or VS
Code, have terminals built into them. You may not need another if you do
all your terminal work from one of these environments. These
recommendations are in case you do want one.

::: panel-tabset
### MacOS

I'd recommend against using the built-in terminal app (called
*Terminal*). It's okay, but there are better options.

My favorite is the free *iTerm2*, which adds a bunch of niceties like
better theming and multiple tabs.

### Windows

The built-in terminal is the favorite of many users. There are a variety
of alternatives you can try, but feel free to stick with the default.
:::

## The shell

The shell takes the commands you type and runs them. It's what matches
the commands you type to actual programs on your system. Your options
for plugins and themes will depend on which shell you choose.

The shell runs anywhere you've got a running operating system, so your
computer has one shell, and your server would have a different one. Even
a Docker Container has a shell available. That means that if you do a
lot of work on a server, you may need to configure your shell twice --
locally and on the server.

::: panel-tabset
### MacOS

The default shell for MacOS (and Linux) is called *bash*. I'd advise you
to switch it out for *zsh*, the most popular *bash
alternative*.[^2-2-cmd-line-1] Bash alternatives are programs that
extend bash with various bells and whistles.

Relative to bash, zsh has a few advantages out of the box, like better
auto-completion. It also has a huge ecosystem of themes to enhance
visual appeal and functionality, and plugins that let your command line
do everything from displaying your git status to controlling your
Spotify playlist.

I'd recommend looking up instructions for how to install zsh using
*Homebrew*.

### Windows

Windows comes with two shells built in, the *Command Shell* (`cmd`) and
the *PowerShell*.

The Command Shell is older and has been superseded by PowerShell. If
you're getting started, you should work with PowerShell. If you've been
using Command Shell on a Windows machine for a long time, most Command
Shell commands work in PowerShell, so it may be worth switching over.

Many Windows users are switching away from Windows shells entirely in
favor of using *Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)*, which allows you to
run a Linux command line (i.e. bash/zsh) on your Windows machine with
minimal configuration, giving you the best of both worlds.
:::

[^2-2-cmd-line-1]: zsh is pronounced by just speaking the letters aloud,
    *zee-ess-aitch*. Some people might disagree and say it's *zeesh*,
    but they're not writing this book, are they?

## Configuration management

Now that you've installed your shell and terminal, you'll want to
customize them. It is possible to customize both zsh and PowerShell
directly. But the best way is to use a configuration manager for your
themes and plugins.

::: panel-tabset
### MacOS

*Prezto* is my favorite configuration and plugin manager for zsh.
*OhMyZsh* is also popular and very good. Feel free to choose either, but
you can only use one.

Once you've installed Prezto, you've got (at least) three places to
configure your command line; the iTerm2 preferences, the zsh
configuration file `.zshrc`, and the Prezto configuration file
`.zpreztorc`. I'd recommend leaving `.zshrc` alone, customizing the look
of the window and the tab behavior in the iTerm2 preferences, and
customizing the text theme and plugins via Prezto.

I tend to be pretty light on customization, but I'd recommend looking
into git plugins and some advanced auto-completion and command history
search functionality.

### Windows

Many people like customizing PowerShell with [*Oh My
Posh*](https://ohmyposh.dev/).
:::

## Text Editors

As you're working on the command like, you'll also be using *text
editors* a fair bit. There are many options for text editors and people
have strong preferences.

Mac OS's default text editor is called TextEdit and it's bad. Don't use
it. Windows users get Notepad, which is somewhat better than TextEdit,
but still not the best option.

You can always edit text files inside your chosen IDE, like VS Code or
RStudio. Others may prefer a standalone text editor. The most popular
these days are probably *Sublime* or *Notepad++* (Windows only).

Unlike with the terminal, there's no deep configuration here. Install
one from the web, configure it as you like, and make sure it's the
default for opening `.txt` and other files you might want to edit in
your system preferences.

## Secure server connections with SSH

One common IT/Admin task is remotely accessing a server from the command
line on your machine. *SSH* -- short for *Secure (Socket) Shell* -- is a
tool for making a secure connection to another computer over an
unsecured network. It's most often used to interact with a server's
command line from your computer's.

SSH requires invoking the `ssh` command line interface from a *local
host* (your computer) with a username and the *remote host's* (server's)
address. For example, connecting to the server at `server.example.com`
as the user `alex` would look like

``` {.bash filename="Terminal"}
> ssh alex@server.example.com
```

Once you run this command, your terminal will open a session to the
server's terminal.

### Understanding SSH keys

Before this can work, you'll have to configure your *SSH keys*, which
come in a set called a *keypair*. Each keypair consists of a *public*
*key* and a *private* *key*. You'll register your public key anywhere
you're trying to SSH into, like a server or git host, but your private
key must be treated as a precious secret.

When you use the `ssh` command, your local machine sends a request to
open an SSH session to the remote and includes the private key with the
request. The remote host verifies the private key with the public key
and opens an encrypted connection.

![](images/ssh.png){fig-alt="A diagram of SSH initialization. The local host sends the private key, the remote checks against the public key, and then opens the session."
width="450"}

It can be hard to remember how to configure SSH. So let's detour into
*public key cryptography*, the underlying technology. Once you've built
a mental model, you can figure out which key goes where without
mechanically remembering.

Public key cryptography uses mathematical operations that are simple in
one direction but hard to reverse to make it easy to check whether a
proffered private key is valid but nearly impossible to fabricate a
private key from a public key.

::: callout-tip
Using the term *key* for both the public and private keys obscures the
differences. I prefer to think of the private key as the *key* and the
public key as the *lock*. Maybe they should have named them that. But no
one asked me.
:::

As a simple example, think of the number $91$ and its prime factors. Do
you know what the prime factors of $91$ are offhand? I do not. It will
probably take a few minutes to figure out the answer, even if you use a
calculator. But if I give you the numbers $7$ and $13$, it takes just a
moment to verify that $7 * 13 = 91$.

In this example, the number $91$ would be the public key and the prime
numbers $7$ and $13$ together would be the private key. This wouldn't
make for very good public key cryptography because it doesn't take long
to figure out that $7$ and $13$ are prime factors of $91$.

In real public key cryptography, the mathematical operations are more
complex and the numbers much, much bigger. So much so that it's
basically impossible to break public SSH keys by guessing.

But that doesn't make SSH foolproof. While it's impossible to fabricate
a private key, it is possible to steal one. Your private key **must** be
kept secret. The best practice is to never move it from the computer
where it was created and never to share it.

In summary, do what you want with your public keys, but don't share your
private keys. Don't share your private keys. Seriously, do not share
your private keys.

## Practical SSH usage

Now that you understand of how SSH works, the steps should be easy to
remember.

1.  Create an SSH keypair on any machine you'll be SSH-ing from (local
    host).
2.  Put the public key anywhere you'll be SSH-ing to (remote host).
3.  Use the `ssh` command to connect.

If you're working on a server, you'll probably create at least two
keypairs. One on your personal computer to SSH to the server, and one on
the server to access outside services that use SSH, like Git.

### Step 1: Create Keypair

You'll create a keypair on any machine you're SSH-ing **from**.

To create an SSH keypair, you should follow a tutorial online. The
keypair will have two parts. The one that ends in `.pub` is -- you
guessed it -- the public key.

You'll usually create only one private key on each machine. If you
follow standard instructions for creating a key, it will use the default
name, probably `id_ed25519`.[^2-2-cmd-line-2] Sticking with the default
name is ideal because the `ssh` command will automatically use it.
You'll have to specify each time you use your key if you don't use the
default name.

[^2-2-cmd-line-2]: The pattern is `id_<encryption type>`. `ed25519` is
    the standard SSH key encryption type as of this writing.

::: callout-note
Remember, you should never move your private key. If you think the
solution to your problem is to move your private key, think again.

Instead of moving your private key, create a new private key on the
machine where you must use SSH and register a second public key on the
remote.
:::

Some organizations require a unique key for each service you're using to
make it easier to swap keys in case of a breach. If so, you won't be
able to use the default key names.

### Step 2: Register the public keys

To register a public key to SSH into a server, you'll add the public key
to the end of the user's `.ssh/authorized_keys` file in their home
directory. You'll have to ensure the permissions on the
`authorized_keys` file are correct -- more on that in [Chapter
@sec-linux].

If you're registering with a service like GitHub.com, there's probably a
text box in the GUI to add an SSH key. Google for instructions on how to
do it.

### Step 3: Use SSH

To use SSH, type `ssh <user>@<host>`. Other commands can use SSH under
the hood, like `git` or `scp`.

::: callout-note
## For Windows users

Windows didn't support SSH out of the box for a long time, so SSH-ing
from Windows required a separate utility called *PuTTY*. More recent
versions of Windows support using SSH directly in PowerShell or Windows
Subsystem for Linux (WSL). If SSH isn't enabled on your machine, Google
for instructions.
:::

If you have multiple SSH keys or didn't use the default flag, you can
specify a particular key with the `-i` flag.

I'd recommend setting up an *SSH config file* if you use SSH a lot. An
SSH config file allows you to create aliases that are shortcuts to SSH
commands including users, hosts, and other details. If you had a long
SSH command like `ssh -i my-ssh-key alex@server.example.com`, you could
shorten it to `ssh alex-server` or whatever you want.

One annoyance about SSH is that it blocks the terminal its using and the
connection will break when your computer goes to sleep. Many people like
using the *tmux* command line utility to help solve these issues.

tmux is a *terminal multiplexer*, which allows you to manipulate
terminal sessions from the command line, including putting sessions into
the background and making sessions durable through sleeps and other
operations. I'm mentioning tmux because many people love it, but I've
found the learning curve too steep for me to use it regularly. Your
mileage may vary.

If you ever run into trouble using SSH, it has one of my favorite
debugging modes. Just add a `-v` to your command for verbose mode. If
that's not enough information, add another `v` for more verbosity with
`-vv`, and if **that's** not enough, add another `v` for super verbose
mode.

## Comprehension Questions

1.  Draw a mental map that includes the following: terminal, shell,
    theme manager, operating system, my laptop
2.  Under what circumstances should you move or share your SSH private
    key?
3.  What is it about SSH public keys that makes them safe to share?

## Lab: Login to the server

In the previous chapter, we got your server up and running. In this lab,
we'll use the provided `.pem` key to log in for the first time.

### Step 1: Grab the server address

From the EC2 page, you can click on the instance ID in blue to see all
the details about your server.

Copy the Public IPv4 DNS address, which starts with $\text{ec2-}$ and
ends with $\text{amazonaws.com}$. You'll need this address throughout
the labs. If you lose it, come back here to get it.

::: callout-tip
### Set a Server Address Variable

In the rest of the labs in this book, I will write the commands using
the bash variable `SERVER_ADDRESS`. If you create that variable, you can
copy the commands from the book.

For example, as I write this, my server has the address
$\text{ec2-54-159-134-39.compute-1.amazonaws.com}$. So I would set my
server address variable on my command line with
`SERVER_ADDRESS=ec2-54-159-134-39.compute-1.amazonaws.com`.

If you're used to R or Python, notice that spaces are not permitted
around `=` when assigning variables in bash.
:::

### Step 2: Log on with the `.pem` key

The `.pem` key you downloaded when you set up the server is the private
key for a pre-registered keypair that will let you SSH into your server
as the admin user (named `ubuntu` on a Ubuntu system).

The `.pem` key is just an SSH key, so that you can SSH to your server
with

``` {.bash filename="Terminal"}
ssh -i do4ds-lab-key.pem \
  ubuntu@SERVER_ADDRESS
```

When you first try this, you're probably going to get an alert that
looks something like this:

``` bash

\@\@\@\@\@\@\@\@\@\@\@\@\@\@\@\@\@\@\@\@\@\@

\@ WARNING: UNPROTECTED PRIVATE KEY FILE! \@

\@\@\@\@\@\@\@\@\@\@\@\@\@\@\@\@\@\@\@\@\@\@

Permissions 0644 for 'do4ds-lab-key.pem' are too open.

It is required that your private key files are NOT accessible by others.

This private key will be ignored.

Load key "do4ds-lab-key.pem": bad permissions

ubuntu@ec2-54-159-134-39.compute-1.amazonaws.com: Permission denied (publickey).
```

Because the keypair is so powerful, AWS requires that you restrict the
access. You'll need to change the permissions before using it to access
the server. We'll get into permissions in [Chapter @sec-linux]. Until
then, you can adjust the permissions by navigating to the correct
directory with the `cd` command and running
`chmod 600 do4ds-lab-key.pem`.

Once you've done that, you can login to your machine as the root user.
You can type `exit` to exit an SSH session and return to your machine.

### Step 3: Create your own SSH key

You shouldn't use the AWS-provided `.pem` key to login to your server
after the first time. It's too powerful. Create a normal SSH key using
the instructions earlier in this chapter. In the next lab, we'll get
that SSH key configured for your user on the server.
