# The Command Line + SSH {#command-line}

The biggest difference between working on your desktop and working on a server is that almost all work on a server is done via the command line -- an all-text interface where you'll interact via commands rather than a point-and-click graphical user interface (GUI).

Once nice thing is that once you feel comfortable using the command line on a server, you'll probably find that there are many things that will get easier for you locally as well! Plus you get to feel like a real hacker.

In this chapter we'll walk through getting access to the command line on your computer and talk about how to connect to a remote server using a protocol called SSH.

## Setting up the command line

The first step to using the command line is to figure out how to use it on your machine. The way you access the command line differs depending on your operating system.

Before you start interacting with the command line on your machine, it's helpful to have a mental model of what you're interacting with.

There are three layers to interacting with the command line -- the terminal, the shell, and the operating system commands.

The *terminal* is the visual program where you'll type in commands. Depending on which terminal you're using, the colors and themes available for the window (yay dark mode!), as will the options for having multiple tabs and panes, and the keyboard shortcuts you'll use to manage them.

The *shell* is the program you're interacting with as you're typing in commands. It's what matches the words you type to actual commands or programs on your system. Depending on which shell you choose, you'll get different options for autocompletion, handy plugins, and coloring and theming of the actual text in your terminal.

Lastly, the *operating system* is what actually runs the commands you're typing in. So the set of commands available to you will differ by whether you're using Windows or Mac or Linux.

It is possible to spend A LOT of time customizing your terminal to be exactly what you like. While it might not be the best use of your time, it is a lot of fun, and having a terminal that's super customized to what you like feels pretty cool.

We're not going to spend much time in this chapter actually playing on the command line -- that will come in the next chapter. Instead, we're going to mostly get everything set up and ready to go.

### If you use Linux

Why are you even reading this section? You're probably already an expert terminal user. Skip down to getting SSH set up.

### If you use MacOS

There are a bunch of things you *can* do with your terminal. I'm not going to exhaust them all. Instead, my goal is to let you know about the various levels at which you can interact, and suggest my favorites.

MacOS comes with a built-in terminal app (conveniently called *Terminal).* It's fine.

If you're going to be using your terminal more than occasionally, I'd recommend using the free [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/), which adds a bunch of niceties like better theming and multiple tabs.

The default shell for MacOS (and Linux) is called `bash`. `Bash` is a program that's been around for a long time, and it's super reliable. Many people (including me) like to replace `bash` with another shell that is basically `bash`+.

Most of these other shells include all the things that `bash` can do and also allow more. I've been using `zsh` for years now and strongly recommend it. In addition to some basic niceties like better autocompletion than `bash`, `zsh` has a huge ecosystem of plugins that can do everything from making it easier to interact with git to controlling your Spotify music from the command line. `zsh` also has some really wonderful theming options that can do things like display your git status right on the command line.

Because there's such a wild array of plugins for `zsh`, there are also options of plugin managers for `zsh`. I recommend `prezto`.

I'm not going to go through the steps of installing and configuring these tools -- there are numerous online walkthroughs and guides.

#### What do I do?

If you want to follow my recommendations, install iTerm2, `zsh`, and prezto.

Then customize the look of the window and tab behavior in the iTerm2 preferences and customize the text theme and plugins vis prezto.

### If you use a Windows machine

::: callout-note
I haven't used a Windows machine in many years. I've collected some recommendations here, but I can't personally vouch for them the way I can my Mac recommendations.

Windows comes with a terminal built in. There are many other terminal programs you *can* use, but many Windows users think that the built in terminal is actually the best option. That makes things easy!

Windows comes with two shells built in, the Command shell (`cmd`) and the PowerShell. The command shell is older and has been superseded by PowerShell. If you're just getting started, you absolutely should just work with PowerShell. If you've been using Command shell on a Windows machine for a long time, most Command shell command work in PowerShell, so it may be worth switching over.

## The structure of a bash command

Once you log into your server, you'll be using bash, whether you're coming from Windows or Mac.

So let's take a moment and understand how to read and use a bash command.

Each command in bash is its own small program and so you can interact with them on the command line in a standard way. There are some commands you just run by themselves, but most commands run with options and arguments.

Arguments tell the command what to run on. For example, the `ls` command lists files in the indicated directory. If you leave the argument blank, it `ls` just lists files in the current directory, but you can also provide an argument of the directory you'd like to see inside.

So `ls` will list the contents of the current directory, while `ls /home/alex` will list the contents of the `/home/alex` directory.

Options or flags are sub-commands that modify how the command operates. Flags are denoted by having one or more dashes before them. For example, the `ls` command, which lists files, has the flag `-l`, which indicates that the files should be displayed as a list.

Flags always come in between the command and any arguments to the command. So, for example, if I type `ls -l /home/alex` in my terminal, I get back the files in `/home/alex` formatted as a list.

Some flags themselves have arguments, which appear after the flag and a space. So, for example, if you're using the `-l` flag on `ls`, you can use the `-D` flag to format the datetime when the file was last updated.

So, for example, running `ls -l -D %Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S /home/alex` will list all the files in `/home/alex` with the date-time of the last update formatted in ISO 8601 format (which is always the correct format for dates. Note that this structure `<command> <flags + flag args> <command args>` is always the structure of a bash command, and can make it hard to read, since you have to figure out how to read all the flags.

All of the flags and arguments for commands can be found in the program's *man page* (short for manual). You can access the man page for any command with `man <command>`. You can scroll the man page with arrow keys and exit with `q`.

## Lab: Accessing your server

### SSH into the server

The `.pem` key you downloaded is the skeleton key to your server. You should be extremely careful with the `.pem` key. In the next chapter, we'll set up an actual user on the server and configure SSH, which is more secure.

But we've got to get started on the server somehow, and using the `.pem` key is the way to do it.

Before we can use it to open the server, we'll need to make a quick change to the permissions on the key. We'll get a lot into users, groups, and permissions in the next chapter. For now, you can just copy paste these commands.

The easiest way to use `my_test_key.pem` key is to open a Terminal right in that folder. Find `my_test_key.pem` key in the Finder (probably in your Downloads folder), you can right-click and hit `New iTerm Window Here` to open a terminal session in the directory where your `.pem` key is.

Now, you can go to your terminal app and run

``` bash
$ chmod 600 my_test_key.pem
```

#TODO: Windows?

In your terminal type the following

``` bash
$ ssh -i my_test_key.pem ubuntu@<Public IPv4 DNS you copied>
```

Type `yes` when prompted, and you're now logged in to your server!

In the next chapter, we'll learn how to do some basic Linux Administration tasks. Let's get going!

## Exercises

1.  Draw your own diagram of the sequence of things that occur when you execute `ssh user@server.company.com` in the terminal.
2.  Create a local text file and SFTP it to the server. SSH in, edit the file, and SFTP it back.
