# DNS allows for human-readable addresses {#sec-dns}

In [Chapter @sec-networking] you learned all about how IP Addresses are
where a host actually lives on a computer network. But you've been using
the internet for a long time and you've rarely -- if ever -- actually
used an IP Address. What gives?

IP Addresses are hard to remember. And worse, they can change when
servers are replaced.

To make the internet a little more human-friendly, the creators of the
internet built the *domain name system* (DNS) that translates between
human-readable *domains* and the IP Addresses where the resources
actually live.

In this chapter, you'll learn the basics about how DNS works and how it
gets configured.[^2-7-dns-1] In the lab, you'll configure your workbench
with an actual domain.

[^2-7-dns-1]: This is really a very shallow intro to DNS. If you want to
    go a little deeper, I highly recommend Julia Evans's zines on a
    variety of technical topics, including DNS. You can find them at
    wizardzines.com.

## Basics of DNS and domains

When you create or launch a website, you'll purchase (rent, really) a
domain like $\text{do4ds.com}$ from a *domain name registrar*.
Purchasing a domain gives you the right to attach that domain to an IP
Address.

When someone comes to visit your website, their computer *resolves* the
IP Address via a *DNS lookup* against public DNS nameservers. So when
you purchase a domain, you register the association between your domain
and the IP Address with the DNS nameservers so users can look them up.

A complete domain is called a *Fully-Qualified Domain Name (FQDN)* and
consists of three parts:

$$
\overbrace{\text{blog}}^{\text{Subdomain}}.\overbrace{\underbrace{\text{example}}_{\text{Domain Name}}.\underbrace{\text{com}}_{\text{Top-Level Domain}}}^{\text{Root Domain}}
$$

When you get a domain from a registrar, the thing you'll actually rent
is the root domain. You can choose any root domain you want, as long as
it's not already taken. Domain names are unique only within top-level
domains, so you might be able to get $\text{example.fun}$ even if
someone else owns $\text{example.com}$.

::: callout-note
## Top-level domains

When the web first launched, there were only a limited number of
top-level domains like $\text{.com}$, $\text{.org}$, and $\text{.net}$.
ICANN, the group that controls how domains are assigned, controlled them
all.

In 2013, ICANN decided to allow people and organizations to register
their own top-level domains. That's why there's been an explosion in
websites at top level domains like $\text{.io}$, $\text{.ai}$, and
$\text{.fun}$ in the last decade or so.

I think it'd be fun to have my own top-level domain, so it's unfortunate
that owning a top-level domain is not something to do on a whim. In
2012, the initial application fee was \$185,000.
:::

Subdomains are a way to specify a part of a domain, usually to signify
to users that its for a distinct purpose. You can generally register as
many subdomains as you want against a root domain.

## How DNS is configured

DNS is configured by giving the proper IP Address information to the
domain name registrar where you bought your domain. There's often some
minor configuration on the server side as well to let the server know
where it lives.

Most places you might serve a website from have instructions on how to
do configure it you can google. The point of this section is just to
make you comfortable with whatever instructions you find in your
googling.

There are a variety of different domain name registrars. Each of the big
3 has their own and there are a number of others including Namecheap (my
personal favorite as it is indeed, cheap), Cloudflare, and GoDaddy.

Costs for domain names vary widely. Buying a meaningless domain in a
less popular top-level domain can cost as little as a few dollars per
year. For example, I was able to get the domain $\text{do4ds-lab.shop}$
for \$1.98 for a year on Namecheap.

On the other hand, buying a $\text{.com}$ domain that's a real word or
phrase can be thousands of dollars. There are articles every few years
about some major company accidentally allowing their domain name to
lapse and ransoming it back for stupid amounts of money.

Once you've purchased your domain, you need to configure the public DNS
records of your domain to point to the IP Address you want.
Configuration of DNS is done by way of *records*. Records map a *path*
or *host* to a *target*.

Depending on the type of mapping, records fall into a number of
different categories, but there are only a few you're likely to see:

-   *A records* (or their IPv6 cousin *AAAA records*) map a domain to an
    actual IP Address.
-   *CNAME records* alias subdomains to another record.
-   *NS records* tells the DNS server to forward the request on to
    another namespace server. This is usually only used by big
    organizations that run their own domain name servers for their
    subdomains.

When you go to configure DNS with your domain name registrar, you'll
configure the records in a record table. Here's an imaginary DNS record
table for the domain $\text{example.com}$:

| Path/Host     | Type    | Target                |
|---------------|---------|-----------------------|
| $\text{@}$    | `A`     | $\text{64.56.223.5}$  |
| $\text{www}$  | `CNAME` | $\text{example.com}$  |
| $\text{blog}$ | `A`     | $\text{114.13.56.77}$ |
| $\text{*}$    | `A`     | $\text{64.56.223.5}$  |

The first row provides an `A` record for the special $\text{@}$ symbol
meaning exact match. So by this configuration, any traffic to
$\text{example.com}$ will be passed straight through to the specified IP
Address.

The second row deals with traffic to the $\text{www}$ subdomain. Since
this is a `CNAME` record, this record indicates that traffic to
$\text{www.example.com}$ should be treated exactly like traffic to the
bare $\text{example.com}$. Some domain providers do automatic
redirection of $\text{www}$ traffic, and so this row may not be
necessary in some configurations.

The next record sends the $\text{blog}$ subdomain to a completely
different IP Address. This is a common configuration when the subdomain
might be owned by a completely different group than the main website or
is served from a different server.

The last record uses the wildcard symbol $\text{*}$ to send all
subdomain traffic that's not already spoken for back to the main IP
Address.

Other than the $\text{www}$ subdomain, which stands for world wide web,
and is generally routed to the same place as the bare root domain, using
subdomains and choosing between subdomains and paths is entirely about
organizing how users experience your website and what's easiest for your
organization to maintain.

::: callout-note
## $\text{www}$ is just a subdomain

When the internet was first started, it seemed like it might be
important to differentiate the subdomain where the website would live
from, for example, the email domain people at that organization would
use.

That turned out not really to be the case and these days $\text{www}$
and the bare root domain are generally used interchangeably.
:::

Once you've configured your DNS records, you will need to wait an
annoyingly long time to see if you did it correctly.

When your computer does a DNS lookup, there are often at least three
nameservers involved. First, your computer talks to a *resolver*, which
is a server that keeps track of where the nameservers are. Then you're
routed to the correct nameserver for the top-level domain, which routes
you to the nameserver for your actual domain.

And then there are various geographic repeats of this whole set of
servers to make sure your query doesn't get slowed down by having to
travel too far.

That means that when you update a DNS record, it can take some time to
propagate to all these servers. The other issue is that your computer,
and each of these servers, tries to do as few lookups as possible,
because they're slow.

When you configure a DNS record, you configure something called the *TTL
(time to live)*. Each level of DNS lookup, may cache the results of
looking up a domain to avoid having to ask the next level. How long that
cache lasts is configured by the TTL.

This is great if you are *using* the internet and don't want to wait for
DNS lookups, but when you're changing the domains on servers you
control, there are many DNS servers that a request could get routed to,
and many of them may have outdated cache entries. That's why DNS changes
can take up to 24 hours to propagate.

That means that if you make a change and it's not working, you have no
idea whether you made a mistake or it just hasn't propagated yet. It's
very annoying.

## Comprehension Questions

1.  What are the parts of a fully-qualified domain name? How does each
    of them get created?
2.  How does your computer find the IP Address for a domain? Why could
    it sometimes be wrong?
3.  What are the different kinds of DNS records you're likely to use?

## Lab: Configuring DNS for your server

In the last lab, we configured the server so that all of the services
were served off of one single port that redirected to various subpaths.

Now we want to get a real, memorable domain for the server so that you
and your users don't have to remember some random `ec2-` domain or an IP
Address. In this lab, we'll configure DNS records for our server so it's
available at a real domain.

### Step 1: Allocate an Elastic IP

EC2 instances get assigned a public IP when they are started. The issue
is that every time the server stops that IP is released and a new one is
assigned when it comes back up. This means you'd have to change your DNS
record every time you temporarily take your server offline -- no good.

Luckily, AWS has a great solution here called *Elastic IP*. which gives
you a stable public IP Address you can move from one instance to another
as you wish.

::: callout-tip
## Paying for Elastic IPs

Elastic IPs are free as long as they're attached to a running EC2
instance. You pay when they're not in use to discourage hoarding them.

If you do take your server down for a short time, it's no big deal. As
of this writing, it's 12 cents per day for a single IP. But do make sure
to release the Elastic IP if/when you take your server down permanently.
:::

To set up your Elastic IP, find it in the AWS console and allocate an
address. Then you will associate your Elastic IP as the default public
IP Address for your instance.

Note that once you make this change, your server will no longer be
available at its old IP Address, so you'll have to SSH in at the new
one. If you have SSH terminals open when you make the change, they will
break.

::: callout-note
Next time you stand up a server, you should start by giving it an
Elastic IP so you are immediately using it's permanent IP Address. The
labs in this book are ordered to promote learning, not the right order
to configure things.
:::

### Step 2: Buy a domain

You can buy a domain from any of the many domain purchasing services on
the web. This won't be free, but many domains are very cheap.

The easiest place to buy a domain is via AWS's *Route53* service, but
you can feel free to use another provider. I usually use Namecheap just
because all of the domains I own are there.

### Step 3: Configure DNS

Once you've got your domain, you have to configure your DNS. You'll have
to create 2 A records -- one each for the $\text{@}$ host and the
$\text{*}$ host pointing to your IP and one for the CNAME at the
$\text{www}$ with the value being your bare domain.

Exactly how you configure this will depend on the domain name provider
you choose. In NameCheap, you configure this via a table under Advanced
DNS, which looks like this.

| Type           | Host         | Value                   | TTL       |
|----------------|--------------|-------------------------|-----------|
| `A` Record     | $\text{*}$   | $\text{64.56.223.5}$    | Automatic |
| `CNAME` Record | $\text{www}$ | $\text{do4ds-lab.shop}$ | Automatic |
| `A` Record     | $\text{@}$   | $\text{64.56.223.5}$    | Automatic |

I would recommend sticking with the default for TTL.

### Step 4: Wait an annoyingly long time

Now you just have to be patient. Unfortunately DNS takes time to
propagate. After a few minutes (or hours?), your server should be
reachable at your domain.

If it's not (yet) reachable, try seeing if an incognito browser works
because that sidesteps the browser level of caching. If it doesn't, wait
some more. When you run out of patience, try reconfiguring everything
and check if it works now.

::: callout-tip
We still haven't configured HTTPS, so you'll need to manually input the
URL as $\text{http://}$, because your browser will otherwise assume it's
HTTPS.
:::

### Step 5: Add the Shiny app to your site

Now that the Shiny app is at a stable URL, let's put it on our site so
people can look at our penguin size prediction model. I put the app at
the subpath $\text{/penguins}$, so it's now at
$\text{http://do4ds-lab.shop/penguins}$.

We're going to use something called an *iFrame*, which lets you embed
one website inside another. An iFrame is a basic HTML construct and it's
easy to put one in a Quarto site.

::: callout-note
Once you change your website to go over HTTPS in the next section,
you'll have to adjust the iFrame URL as well.
:::

In Quarto, you can just add an `html` block to a any document and it
will get loaded in automatically. I want the app on the landing page of
my site, `index.qmd`. So I've added a block that looks like:

``` {.html filename="index.qmd"}
<iframe width="780" height="500" src="http://do4ds-lab.shop/penguins/" title="Penguin Model Explorer"></iframe>
```
