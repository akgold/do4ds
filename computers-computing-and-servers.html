<p>Data Science is a delightful mashup of statistics and computer science. While you can be a great data scientists without a deep understanding of computational theory, a mental model of how your computer works is helpful, especially when you head to production.</p>
<p>In this chapter, we’ll develop a mental model for how computers work, and explore how well that mental model applies to both the familiar computers in your life, but also more remote servers.</p>
<p>If you’re into pedantic nitpicking, you’re going to love this chapter apart, as I’ve grossly oversimplified how computers work. On the other hand, this basic mental model has served me well across hundreds of interactions with data scientists and IT/DevOps professionals.</p>
<p>And by the end of the chapter, we’ll get super practical – giving you a how-to on getting a server of your very own to play with.</p>
<div id="computers-are-addition-factories" class="section level2">
<h2>
<span class="header-section-number">4.1</span> Computers are addition factories<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#computers-are-addition-factories"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>As a data scientist, the amount of computational theory it’s really helpful to understand in your day-to-day can be summarized in three sentences:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Computers can only add.</p>
<p>Modern ones do so very well and very fast.</p>
<p>Everything a computer “does” is just adding two (usually very large) numbers, reinterpreted.<a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content='&lt;p&gt;The reason why this is the case and how it works is fascinating. If you’re interested, it comes back to Alan Turing’s famous paper on computability. I recommend &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/2333956.The_Annotated_Turing"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Annotated Turing: A Guided Tour Through Alan Turing’s Historic Paper on Computability and the Turing Machine&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by Charles Petzold for a surprisingly readable walkthrough of the paper.&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>1</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I like to think of computers as factories for doing addition problems.</p>
<div class="inline-figure"><img src="images/200-servers/data_science_machine.drawio.svg" title="Mental Model of a Computer"></div>
<p>We see meaning in typing the word <em>umbrella</em> or jumping Mario over a Chomp Chain and we interpret something from the output of some R code or listening to Carly Rae Jepsen’s newest bop, but to your computer it’s all just addition.</p>
<p>Every bit of input you provide your computer is homogenized into addition problems. Once those problems are done, the results are reverted back into something we interpret as meaningful. Obviously the details of that conversion are complicated and important – but for the purposes of understanding what your computer’s doing when you clean some data or run a machine learning model, you don’t have to understand much more than that.</p>
<div id="compute" class="section level3">
<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">4.1.1</span> Compute<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#compute"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>The addition assembly line itself – where the work actually gets done – is referred to as compute. It’s where 2+2 gets turned into 4, and where 345619912 + 182347910 gets turned into 527967822. The heart of the factory in your computer is the central processing unit (CPU).</p>
<p>There are two elements to the total speed of your compute – the total number of cores, which you can think of as an individual conveyor belt doing a single problem at a time, and the speed at which each belt is running.</p>
<p>These days, most consumer-grade laptops have between 4 and 16 cores, and may have additional capabilities that effectively doubles that number. So most laptop CPUs can do between 4 and 32 simultaneous addition problems.</p>
<p>In your computer, the basic measure of conveyor belt speed is single-core “clock speed” in hertz (hz) – operations per second. The cores in your laptop probably run between 2-5 gigahertz (GHz): 2-5 billion operations per second.</p>
<aside><p>A few decades ago, there was a steady march in increases in clock speed – increasing by approximately 10x during the 90s, by 2-3x in the 2000s, and somewhere between not at all and 1.5x in the 2010s. Computers have gotten much faster through this entire time, but mostly from sources other than boosts in single-core clock speeds.</p>
<p>For example, in 2020, Apple released a series of Macs with its new M1 chip. Real-world performance of the M1 chip was dramatically better than earlier models, despite modest improvements in clock speeds.</p>
</aside><div id="gpu-computing" class="section level4">
<h4>
<span class="header-section-number">4.1.1.1</span> GPU Computing<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#gpu-computing"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h4>
<p>While compute usually just refers to the CPU, it’s not completely synonymous. Computers can offload some problems to a graphical processing unit (GPU). GPUs are specialized chips used for tasks like editing photo or videos, rendering video game graphics, some kinds of machine learning, and (yes) Bitcoin mining.</p>
<p>Where the CPU has a few fast cores, the GPU takes the opposite approach, with many slower cores. Where a consumer-grade CPU has 4-16 cores, mid-range GPUs have 700-4,000, but each one runs between 1% and 10% the speed of a CPU core.</p>
<p>For GPU-centric tasks, the overwhelming parallelism of a GPU is more important than the speed of any individual core, and GPU computation can be dramatically faster. For the purposes of data science, many popular machine learning techniques – including neural networks, XGBoost, and other tree-based models – potentially run much much faster on GPUs relative to CPUs.</p>

<div id="memory-ram" class="section level3">
<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">4.1.2</span> Memory (RAM)<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#memory-ram"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>Your computer’s random access memory (RAM) is its short term storage. Your computer uses RAM to store addition problems it’s going to tackle soon, and results it thinks it might need again in the near future.</p>
<p>The benefit of RAM is that it’s very fast to access. The downside is that it’s temporary. When your computer turns off, the RAM gets wiped.<a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="&lt;p&gt;You probably don’t experience this personally. Modern computers are pretty smart about dumping RAM onto the hard disk before shutting down, and bringing it back on startup, so you usually won’t notice this happening.&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<aside><p>You probably know this, but memory and storage is measured in bytes. These days, most consumer hard drives are between 1/2 to a few terrabytes (trillion bytes). Some enterprise data stores run on the scales of thousands of terrabytes (pettabytes) or even thousands of pettabytes (yottabytes).</p>
</aside><p>Modern consumer-grade laptops come with somewhere between 4 and 16 Gb of memory.</p>
</div>
<div id="storage-hard-drivedisk" class="section level3">
<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">4.1.3</span> Storage (Hard Drive/Disk)<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#storage-hard-drivedisk"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>Your computer’s storage is like a freezer. It keeps things permanently, whether the factory is operating or not. The tradeoff is that things there are cold, and take some time to warm up before they can be used.</p>
<p>A few years ago, all hard drives were (HDDs), and were basically the same. HDDs have a bunch of magnetic disks that spin very fast (5,400 and 7,200 RPM are common speeds). Magnetized read/write heads move among the disks and save and read your data.</p>
<p>In the last few years, solid-state drives (SSDs) have been taking over. SSDs, which are collections of flash memory chips, are up to 15x faster than HDDs. They also can take a wider variety of shapes and sizes, and are more reliable and durable because they have no moving parts. The main drawback is that they’re usually more expensive per byte, but prices are still quite reasonable.</p>
<p>Many consumer laptops have only an SSD at this point. Some desktops and high-end laptops combine a smaller SSD with a larger HDD.</p>

<h2>
<span class="header-section-number">4.2</span> Choosing the right data science machine<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#choosing-the-right-data-science-machine"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>In my experience as a data scientist and talking to IT/DevOps organizations trying to equip data scientists, the same questions about choosing a computer come up over and over again. Here are the guidelines I often share.</p>
<div id="get-as-much-ram-as-feasible" class="section level3">
<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">4.2.1</span> Get as much RAM as feasible<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#get-as-much-ram-as-feasible"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>In most cases, R and Python have to load all of your data into memory. Thus, the size of the data you can use is limited to the size of your machine’s RAM. Most other limits of your machine will just result in things being slower than you’d really want, but trying to load too much data into memory will result in a session crash, and you won’t be able to do your analysis.</p>
<aside><p>You can get around the in-memory limitation by using a <a href="choosing-and-using-a-data-architecture.html#database">database</a> or libraries that facilitate on-disk operations like <a href="https://arrow.apache.org/">Apache Arrow</a> or <a href="https://docs.dask.org/en/latest/why.html">dask</a>.</p>
</aside><p>It’s easy to say that you’ll always want more RAM, but a rough rule of thumb for whether you’ve got enough is the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Amount of RAM = max amount of data * 3</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Because you’ll often be doing some sort of transformation that results in invisible data copies and your computer can’t devote all of its memory, you’ll want to leave plenty of room over your actual data size. I’ve never run into problems with a scaling factor of 3, but this is definitely only a rough rule-of-thumb.</p>
</div>
<div id="go-for-fewer-faster-cores-in-the-cpu" class="section level3">
<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">4.2.2</span> Go for fewer, faster cores in the CPU<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#go-for-fewer-faster-cores-in-the-cpu"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>R and Python are single-threaded. Unless you’re using special libraries for parallel processing, you’ll end up red-lining a single CPU core while the other just look on in silence. Therefore, single core clock speed matters more than the number of cores, and fewer, faster cores are usually preferable to many slower</p>
<p>If you’re buying a laptop or desktop, there usually aren’t explicit choices between a few fast cores and more slow cores. Most modern CPUs are pretty darn good, and you should just get one that fits your budget. If you’re standing up a server, you often have an explicit choice between more slower cores and fewer faster ones.</p>
</div>
<div id="get-a-gpumaybe" class="section level3">
<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">4.2.3</span> Get a GPU…maybe…<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#get-a-gpumaybe"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>If you’re doing machine learning that can be improved by GPU-backed operations, you might want a GPU. In general, only highly parallel machine learning problems like training a neural network or tree-based models will benefit from GPU computation.</p>
<p>On the other hand, GPUs are expensive, non-machine learning tasks like data processing don’t benefit from GPU computation, and many machine learning tasks are amenable to linear models that run well CPU-only.</p>
</div>
<div id="get-a-lot-of-storage-its-cheap" class="section level3">
<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">4.2.4</span> Get a lot of storage, it’s cheap<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#get-a-lot-of-storage-its-cheap"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>As for storage – get a lot – but don’t think about it too hard, because it’s cheap. Both a 1TB SSD and a 4TB HDD are around $100. Storage is cheap enough these days that it is almost always more cost efficient to buy more storage rather than making a highly-paid professional spend their time trying to figure out how to move things around.</p>
<p>One litmus test of an IT organization that is well-equipped to support data science is whether they understand this. Smart organizations know that just getting more storage is easily worth the cost in terms of the time of admins and data scientists.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="is-a-server-different" class="section level2">
<h2>
<span class="header-section-number">4.3</span> Is a server different?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#is-a-server-different"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>No.</p>
<p>But also yes.</p>
<p>At its core, a server is exactly the same sort of addition factory as your laptop, and the same mental model of what is happening under the hood will serve you well.</p>
<div class="inline-figure"><img src="images/200-servers/desktop-vs-server.drawio.svg" title="Desktop vs Server"></div>
<p>The big difference is in how the input and output is done. While you interact directly with a computer through keyboard and mouse/touchpad, servers generally don’t have built in graphical interfaces – by default all interaction occurs via command line tools.</p>
<p>One of the reasons is that the overwhelming majority of the world’s servers run the <em>Linux</em> operating system, as opposed to the Windows or Mac OS your laptop probably runs.<a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="&lt;p&gt;There are Windows Server versions that are reasonably popular in enterprises. There are no Mac servers. There is a product called &lt;em&gt;Mac Server&lt;/em&gt;, but it’s used to manage Mac desktops and iOS devices, not a real server.&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>3</sup></a> There are many different distributions (usually called “distros”) of Linux. For day-to-day enterprise server use, the most common of these are Ubuntu, CentOS, Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), SUSE Enterprise Linux.</p>
<p>Along with most of the world’s servers, almost all of the world’s embedded computers – in ATMs, cars and planes, TVs, and most other gadgets and gizmos – run on Linux. If you have an Android phone or a Chromebook – that’s Linux. Basically all of the world’s supercomputers use Linux.</p>
