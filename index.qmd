# Welcome! {.unnumbered}

In this book, you'll learn about DevOps conventions, tools, and
practices that can be useful to you as a data scientist. You'll also
learn how to work better with the IT/Admin team at your organization,
and even how to do a little server administration of your own if you're

## Acknowledgments {.unnumbered}

Thank you to current and former members of the Solutions Engineering
team at Posit, who taught me most of what's in this book.

Huge thanks to the R4DS book club, especially Jon Harmon, Gus Lipkin,
and Tinashe Michael Tapera, who read an early (and rough!) copy of this
book and gave me amazing feedback.

Thanks to all others who provided improvements that ended up in this
book (in alphabetical order): Carl Boettinger, Jon Harmon, Gus Lipkin,
and Leungi.

Thanks to Randi Cohen at Taylor and Francis and to Linda Kahn, who's
always been more than an editor to me. Thanks to Larry Gold for
providing the wonderful cover art for the print version â€“ along with so
much more over the years.

Thanks to Eliot who cared enough about this project to insist he appear
in the acknowledgments. Most of all, thanks to Shoshana for helping me
live my best life.
