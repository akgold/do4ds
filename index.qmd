# Welcome! {.unnumbered}

This is the website for the book *DevOps for Data Science*, currently in
draft form.

::: callout-warning
This book is very much still a work in progress.

The content is mostly here, but I am still rewriting, polishing, and
rearranging.

Content is likely to move from section to section and chapter to
chapter.

Links are likely to break.

Thanks for your patience.
:::

In this book, you'll learn about DevOps conventions, tools, and
practices that can be useful to you as a data scientist. You'll also
learn how to work better with the IT/Admin team at your organization,
and even how to do a little server administration of your own if you're
pressed into service.

If you'd like a **physical copy** of the book, they will be available
once it's finished!

## Software information and conventions {.unnumbered}

I used the **knitr**\index{knitr} package [@xie2015] and the
**quarto**\index{quarto} package [@quarto] to compile my book.

Package names are in bold text (e.g., **rmarkdown**), and inline code
and filenames are formatted in a typewriter font (e.g.,
`knitr::knit('foo.Rmd')`). Function names are followed by parentheses
(e.g., `bookdown::render_book()`).
