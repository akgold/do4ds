<h1><span class="header-section-number">Chapter 3</span> Computers and Servers</h1>
<p>Data Science is fundamentally a computational practice. At some level, the day-to-day work of data scientists is inextricable from the computational waters in which that work occurs. Luckily, being a productive data science does not rely on deep understanding of computational theory.</p>
<p>But for a working data scientist, understanding the computational substrate below your R or Python code can give you a much better feel for how to get your work done quickly and efficiently. Moreover, as more and more data science moves into centralized server-based environments, having a mental model for how that environment is like and unlike your more-familiar laptop or phone can help you be more productive.</p>
<p>In this chapter, you’ll learn about the important components inside your computer for data science work and the similarities and differences it has with a server-based environment. If you’re near your computer and ready to try it out, you’ll have stood up a server of your very own by the end of the chapter.</p>
<div id="a-computer-is-really-just-three-things" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.1</span> A computer is really just three things…</h2>
<p>For the purposes of doing data science, a computer is just a collection of three interacting components. This is obviously a gross oversimplification of how a computer works, Everything I’m saying below is an oversimplification, and if you’re into pedantic nitpicking, I hope you have a good time picking apart why what I’m saying is not quite right. However, in the spirit of <em>all models are wrong, but some are useful</em>, I’ve found this to be an extremely useful mental model of what’s going on in a computer that hasn’t served me wrong across hundreds of interactions with data scientists and IT/DevOps professionals.</p>
<p><img src="images/data_science_machine.jpeg" width="431" /></p>
<p>Let’s go through each of these pieces.</p>
<div id="input-output" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.1.1</span> Input + Output</h3>
<p><strong>Input and Output</strong> are whatever is going into and coming out from the computer. For human purposes, there are myriad ways to provide input and receive output. You might provide input with your keyboard and mouse, a microphone or camera, or by sending a call to a server. And you might get output through your computer or phone screen, a set of speakers, or a returned API call.</p>
<p>For the purposes of understanding how your computer does things, it’s helpful to think of all of this input and output as having been homogenized. Your computer homogenizes everything you do on your computer – from walking left in a video game to typing the word <em>umbrella</em> for your next novel, creating a plot in R to sending the results of a machine learning model. Fundamentally, you can think of every bit of input as a request to add some numbers, and every bit of output as the result of an addition.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div id="compute-cpu-gpu" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.1.2</span> Compute (CPU + GPU)</h3>
<p>If everything your computer does is adding two numbers, the compute is where that addition happens. Your computer is very, very good at adding very, very fast.</p>
<p>Every computer has a central processing unit (CPU), which is the brain of your computer. For the purposes of this mental model, you can think of it as <em>the main adding factory</em>. Those additions happen inside a <em>core</em>, which you can think of as a place that can do a single addition at a time. These days, most consumer-grade laptops have between 4 and 16 cores pretty fast cores, and may have additional capabilities that effectively doubles that number.</p>
<p>Some computers also have a graphical processing unit (GPU). If you have a GPU, you can think of it as part of the same compute complex as your CPU, but differently specialized. Where a CPU has a relatively low number of fast cores, a GPU has a lot of weak cores. Where a consumer-grade CPU has 4-16 cores, mid-range GPUs have 700-4,000.</p>
<p>For some uses, like editing photo or videos, playing video games, some kinds of machine learning, and Bitcoin mining, it turns out the “many slow cores” architecture of a GPU drastically speeds up computation relative to having to do those same computations in serial (one at a time).</p>
<p>From a configuration and usage perspective CPUs and GPUs are quite different. In particular, using a CPU is automatic, while using a GPU can be a hassle – though it’s getting easier all the time. However, for your mental model of a computer, you can fundamentally think of the two as being combined into a big adding factory you think of as the compute available.</p>
<p>Two of the three important attributes of your computer are about the available compute - the <strong>number of cores</strong> and <strong>single-core speed</strong>.</p>
<p>As you’ve probably heard, <strong>R and Python are single-threaded</strong>. This means that, unless you’re using special libraries for parallel processing, R and Python will just use a single core.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For data science work in R and Python, single-core speed matters much more than number of cores.</p>
<p>Fewer, faster cores is generally more important than having many cores.</p>
<p>If you want to scale across multiple R or Python sessions at the same time – for example to allow multiple users on a server – then you’ll care more about the number of cores.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The number of cores in your computer is straightforward – it’s the number of cores your CPU has, sometimes times 2. Regardless of your operating system, it’s pretty trivial to determine how many cores your machine has.</p>
<p>Comparing CPU speed is harder to boil down to a single number. The basic measure of single-core speed is its “clock speed” in hertz (hz) – operations per second. Modern consumer-grade cores run on the order of 2-5 gigahertz (GHz): 2-5 billion operations per second.</p>
<aside>
<p>A few decades ago, there was a steady march in increases in clock speed – increasing by approximately 10x during the 90s, by 2-3x in the 2000s, and somewhere between not at all and 1.5x in the 2010s. Computers have gotten much faster through this entire time, but mostly from sources other than boosts in single-core clock speeds.</p>
</aside>
<p>But real-world performance doesn’t always track precisely with the GHz speed of the cores. For example, in 2020, Apple released a series of Macs with its new M1 chip. It boasted improved real-world performance over earlier Macs – even those with similar clock speeds – through some clever architectural changes.</p>
<p>The good news is that if you’re shopping for a new laptop, pretty much all modern CPUs are pretty darn fast and they scale roughly with cost. If you’re looking to set up a server to do data science, the big cloud providers use standard chipsets, so clock speed in GHz actually is a decent guide to the relative speed of the different CPU options available.</p>
</div>
<div id="storage-hard-drivedisk" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.1.3</span> Storage (Hard Drive/Disk)</h3>
<p>Your computer’s hard drive is its permanent storage. Even when no electricity is supplied to your hard drive, it will keep the things you’ve stored there.</p>
<aside>
<p>You probably know this, but storage is measured in bytes. These days, most consumer hard drives are between 1/2 to a few terrabytes (trillion bytes). Enterprise-grade applications sometimes run on the scales of thousands of terrabytes (pettabytes) or even thousands of pettabytes (yottabytes).</p>
</aside>
<p>A few years ago, all hard drives were basically the same. For standard hard drives (HDDs), there are a bunch of disks that spin very very fast (5,400 and 7,200 RPMs are common speeds). A magnetized read/write head moved among the disks and did the data operations you needed.</p>
<p>These days, solid-state drives (SSDs), which are collections of flash memory chips, are taking over the world. The main advantage is that they’re much faster than HDDs – up to 15x or so. They also can take a wider variety of shapes and sizes, and are more reliable and durable because they have no moving parts. The main drawback is that you get much less storage for the price.</p>
<p>Many computers and systems are SSD only at this point. Some high-end ones combine a smaller SSD with a larger HDD to make sure you never run out of room, but can keep things you need a lot in an easier-to-access location.</p>
<p>The main thing that matters in your mental model of storage is that it’s cold storage. Everything has to move out of permanent storage before it can be used, which is a relatively slow operation, even on an SSD.</p>
<p>If you’re thinking about what hard drive to get for your laptop or server, the short answer is just to get a lot. Storage is very cheap these days, and also easily extensible via the cloud or external hard drives. This attribute of your computer sorta matters, but is of second-tier importance.</p>
</div>
<div id="memory-ram" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.1.4</span> Memory (RAM)</h3>
<p>RAM (Random Access Memory) is temporary storage where your computer puts things it’s actively using, or thinks it might need again soon. Modern consumer-grade laptops come with somewhere between 4 and 16 Gb of memory.</p>
<p>In theory, your computer doesn’t need any RAM at all – it could just save everything to the hard drive, but even with an SSD, your CPU to RAM read/write times are somewhere between 10-100 times faster than going to the hard drive.</p>
<p>The tradeoff for this speed is that RAM requires electricity to function. When you turn off your computer, the RAM is emptied. These days, computers mostly suspend what you had going on to the hard disk, so everything comes back more-or-less how it was when you turn your computer back on. To a first approximation, putting your computer to sleep means turning off everything but keeping the RAM intact.</p>
<p>If you’re coding in R or Python, amount of RAM is likely to be the first IT hurdle you run into. R and Python only work with data that’s been loaded into memory, so you when you look at a command like</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb3"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb3-1"><a href="computers-and-servers.html#cb3-1"></a>df &lt;-<span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">read.csv</span>(<span class="st">&quot;my_csv.csv&quot;</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>or</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb4"><pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb4-1"><a href="computers-and-servers.html#cb4-1"></a><span class="im">import</span> pandas <span class="im">as</span> pd</span>
<span id="cb4-2"><a href="computers-and-servers.html#cb4-2"></a>data <span class="op">=</span> pd.read_csv(<span class="st">&quot;my_csv.csv&quot;</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>you can read this as “take a csv that’s on my hard drive and move that data into memory”.</p>
<p>It’s pretty easy in R or Python to try to load too much data into memory and end up crashing your session.</p>
<p>You can get around the in-memory limitation by using a <a href="choosing-and-using-a-data-architecture.html#database">database</a> or libraries that facilitate on-disk operations like Apache Arrow. Depending on the size of your data and how computationally intensive your work is, this can be a real limitation on where you can do your work.</p>
<p>Getting more RAM is one reason some data scientists decide to move to a server – as you can rent a server with 1000 times as much RAM – though ones that big are quite costly.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="choosing-the-right-data-science-machine" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.2</span> Choosing the right data science machine</h2>
<p>Now that you understand how compute, storage, and memory work together to execute your R or Python code, let’s dig into the attributes you might care about when choosing a data science machine.</p>
<p>It’s pretty hard to make any definitive rules for how big of a machine you need, because it depends so heavily on what you’re trying to do, but there are some guides and rules of thumb that can be useful to keep in mind. In general, there are only three attributes (plus two) to really care about for your data science machine.</p>
<p>The three attributes you should choose a machine on are (in order): the <strong>amount of RAM</strong>, the <strong>single-core speed</strong>, and the <strong>number of cores</strong>. Depending on your use case, you may also care about making sure you have access to a GPU, and you should make sure you’ve got enough storage for what you need to do.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The number one consideration for a data science machine is having enough RAM.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Most other issues are pretty quickly fixable or will just result in operations being somewhat slower than you’d ideally want. If you don’t have enough RAM, you simply won’t be able to do an analysis because your computer can’t hold all the data in memory.</p>
<p>As a very rough rule of thumb, I’ve never run into trouble with the following formula:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Amount of RAM = average data size * number of simultaneous data sets loaded * 3</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Because you’ll often be doing some sort of transformation to your data, you’ll want to leave plenty of head room for invisible copies of your data, or for the possibility you underestimated your average data size. I’ve never run into problems with a scaling factor of 3, but this is definitely only a rough rule-of-thumb.</p>
<p>Once you’re sure you’ve got enough RAM – and you can basically never have enough – the two other most important considerations are the number of cores and their speed. Since R and Python are single-threaded, single-core performance is generally more important than the number of cores. The number of cores generally only becomes important if you’re trying to support many people or jobs working on the same server at once.</p>
<p>When you’re thinking about how to choose a CPU, fewer, faster cores are preferable to lots of cores. If you’re buying a laptop or desktop, you probably don’t need to think much about this, but if you’re configuring a server, this is often a choice you’re able to make quite directly. If you’re doing massively parallel operations, you should use a GPU anyway.</p>
</div>
<div id="how-is-a-server-different" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.3</span> How is a server different?</h2>
<p>Before I was intimately acquainted with servers, they felt like the Shaolin Temple of computers – incredibly powerful, probably housed on a mountainside shrouded by clouds, maybe even a little mystical. As I started knowingly interacting with servers on a daily basis, I learned the reality was far more prosaic and stripmall-esque.</p>
<p>You already understand how a server works. It’s as simple as taking the input streams you’ve conceptualized as coming from a keyboard, mouse, and microphone and thinking of them instead as requests from other computers, and taking the output going directly to your desktop and thinking of them as responses to those requests.</p>
<p><img src="images/200-servers/desktop_v_server.jpeg" width="424" /></p>
<p>While those input and output streams may change, what goes on in between is exactly the same. It’s all just a bunch of addition in compute, with short term memory, and long-term storage.</p>
<aside>
<p>That’s not to say the input and output format don’t matter. We’ll spend a lot of this book reviewing how to make sure servers can get the input they need, can filter out bad input, and return output to the right place. It’s just that your mental model of what the server does needn’t incorporate this element.</p>
</aside>
<p>In terms of where these machines live, the most common answer is really boring-looking office parks. In today’s world, most servers are rented from one of the big cloud providers or are in rented space in a compute center.</p>
<p>In the remainder of this book, you’ll get really comfortable with servers. By the time you’re done, you should have a pretty thorough understanding of what servers are, how to get and interact with one, and how to make sure the way you use them is secure. But, in case you didn’t realize it, you already interact with servers constantly in your daily life. A few examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>When you request directions from a mapping app on your phone, your phone makes a request to a server programming interface (API). The servers compute the directions you need and send them back to your phone in a specialized format. Your phone then renders the directions you need to your screen.</p></li>
<li><p>When you navigate to a website, that company’s servers send your computer back the components that make up that webpage. Your computer knows how to take those components and render them for you to view.</p></li>
<li><p>When you use your credit card at the grocery store, the credit card machine reaches out to the company’s servers to verify that your card is valid and check that the item you’re trying to purchase doesn’t put you over your credit limit before verifying that the purchase is ok.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see in the examples above, the biggest shift in mental model between your desktop computer and a server is where the connection comes from. For your desktop computer, a human is just one hop away – typing on the keyboard and looking at the screen. For a server, humans are always at least two hops away, using another computer to send requests off to the server and get responses back.</p>
<p>The big difference between those examples and what we’ll be doing for much of the rest of this book is how you’re interacting with the server. In the examples above, you’re interacting with a publicly-exposed application layer of a server. Throughout the rest of this book, we’ll get comfortable interacting with servers you rent or own as an administrator.</p>
<div id="most-servers-run-linux" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.3.1</span> Most servers run Linux</h3>
<p>When you want to do something administrative on your laptop – say install a new program, or change screen resolutions – you probably just open a window on your machine. Those are features of your computer’s operating system – the most common being Mac OS or Windows.</p>
<p>A computer’s operating system forms the basic interface between the computer’s hardware and the software you want to run to actually do things. It includes the software for how the computer boots up, the background services (audio, printing, etc), and the desktop you interact with when switching from one application to another.</p>
<p>Most people think exclusively of Mac OS or Windows when thinking of operating systems, as they rule the desktop computing world. But those computers are vastly outnumbered by the number and variety of servers and other computing platform that are running <em>Linux</em>.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>Along with most of the world’s servers, almost all of the world’s embedded computers – in ATMs, cars and planes, TVs, and most other gadgets and gizmos – run on Linux. If you have an Android phone or a Chromebook – that’s Linux. Basically all of the world’s supercomputers use Linux.</p>
<p>There are many different distributions (usually called “distros”) of Linux. For day-to-day enterprise server use, the most common of these are Ubuntu, CentOS, Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), SUSE Enterprise Linux.</p>
<p>Because of its ubiquity in the server world, we’ll be using Linux servers and distributions for the rest of this book.</p>
</div>
<div id="an-aside-on-open-source" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.3.2</span> An aside on open source</h3>
<p>I personally find open source software fascinating.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> As a data scientist working in R or Python, you might care about the water you’re swimming in. If you don’t, that’s fine too and you don’t need to worry about this. Feel free to skip ahead.</p>
<p>Unlike Mac OS or Windows, Linux is open source. You’ve probably already heard of open source licensing, as the R and Python languages themselves, as well as the packages and libraries you use with them, are open source licensed.</p>
<p>What it means to be open sourced is that if you want to read the code for Windows or Mac OS, you have to go get a job at Microsoft or Apple and join a team working on those code bases. In contrast, a quick google search will allow you to read the source code for Linux, R, Python, pandas, or the tidyverse.</p>
<p>Reading source code is one thing, but the fascinating (and controversial) part of open source licensing is when it comes to reuse. There is a menagerie of different types of open source licenses. The differences between open source licenses mainly concern how permissible they are in terms of reuse of the software. In contrast to the permissibility of standard copyright, which is about whether and how you’re allowed to create derivative works, the variations in open source licenses are about how you’re allowed to license permissive works.</p>
<p>The most permissive open source licenses basically amount to “do whatever you want with my software”, while more restrictive ones, often called <em>copyleft</em>, require that any derivative works also be open source. There have even been discussions recently of creating open source licenses that restrict the usage of the software along certain ethical dimensions.</p>
<p>In a “traditional” software company, software is written by the company, and the software is then sold to make money. Increasingly, companies are writing open source software and monetizing this business in a number of different ways.</p>
<p>Many versions of Linux are free, while others have an associated cost. Even more confusingly, there are several distributions that share a common codebase, where some are free and some paid. For example, Red Hat, the company behind the paid RHEL are also the primary maintainers of CentOS, and CentOS is the basis for Amazon Linux, which you can get on an Amazon Web Services Server (more on that in a moment).</p>

<div id="moving-data-science-to-a-server" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.4</span> Moving Data Science to A Server</h2>
<p>Many organizations run their data science workloads on a server, as opposed to on each employee’s laptop. In recent years, as data science has become more important, this has been happening more and more commonly. Depending on your organization, the centralization of data science operations can make your life way easier – or it can be kinda a bummer.</p>
<div id="data-scientist-led-server-migration" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.4.1</span> Data Scientist-led server migration</h3>
<p>Often, migrations to a server are instigated by the data scientists themselves – usually because they’ve run out of horsepower on their laptops. These migrations tend to be partial, temporary, and often kinda slapdash.</p>
<p>They’re configured for the purposes of a single project, and are managed by the data scientists themselves.</p>
<p>If you, or one of your teammates, enjoys and is good as SysAdmin work, this can be a great situation! You get the hardware you need for your project quickly and with minimal interference.</p>
<p>On the other hand, most data scientists don’t really want to be SysAdmins, and these systems are often fragile, isolated from other corporate systems, and potentially susceptible to security vulnerabilities.</p>
</div>
<div id="sysadmin-led-server-migration" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.4.2</span> SysAdmin-led server migration</h3>
<p>Many other organizations are moving to servers as well, but led by the IT group. For many IT groups, it’s way easier to maintain a centralized server environment, as opposed to helping each data scientist maintain their own environment on their laptop.</p>
<p>Having just one platform makes it much easier to give shared access to more powerful computing platforms, to data sources that require some configuration, and to R and Python packages that wrap around system libraries and can be a pain to configure (looking at you, <code>rJava</code>).</p>
<p>This can be a great situation for data scientists! If the platform is well-configured and scoped, you can get instant access through their web browser to more compute resources, and don’t have to worry about maintaining local installations of data science tools like R, Python, RStudio, and Jupyter, and you don’t need to worry about how to connect to important data sources – those things are just available for use.</p>
<p>But this can also be a bad experience. Long wait times for hardware or software updates, overly restrictive policies – especially around package management – and misunderstandings of what data scientists are trying to do on the platforms can lead to servers going largely unused.</p>
<p>So much of whether the server-based experience is good or not depends on the relationship between the data science and IT/Admin group. In organizations where these groups work together smoothly, this can be a huge win for everyone involved. However, there are some organizations where IT/Admins are so concerned with stability and security that they make it impossible to do data science, and the data scientists spend all their time playing cat-and-mouse games to try to get work done behind IT/Admin’s backs.</p>
<p>If you work at such a place, it’s frankly hard to get much done on the server. It’s probably worth investing some time into improving your relationship with your favorite person on the IT/Admin team. Hopefully, this book will help you understand a little of what’s on the minds of people in the IT group, and a sense of how to talk to them better.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.5</span> Getting a server of your own</h2>
<p>Let’s completely switch gears and get practical.</p>
<p>Until now, this chapter has been entirely background. If you read it, hopefully you learned a little about a computer works, how your computer is mostly like, but a little unlike a server, and why you might be doing data science on a server.</p>
<p>If you’re reading this book, you probably want a deeper understanding of how using and maintaining a server actually works. In the last section of this chapter, we’ll walk through how you can get a server of your very own.</p>
<p>In contrast to the computer sitting on your desk, you’ll have to access it over the internet and you’ll use a specialized access protocol called <a href="ssh.html#ssh">SSH</a>. Those topics are important enough that there are standalone chapters on them. For now, we’re going to gloss entirely over the how and why and just get you to running a server. If you follow along from this point, it’ll probably take you 10-15 minutes to be running a server of your own.</p>
<p>We’re going to be standing up a server on Amazon Web Services (AWS). In particular, we’ll be standing up a server in their <em>free tier</em> – so there will be no cost involved as long as you haven’t used up all your AWS free tier credits before now.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.5.1</span> Login to the AWS Console</h3>
<p>We’re going to start by logging into AWS. If you’ve done this before, just go ahead and log in.</p>
<p>If not, go to aws.amazon.com and click <code>Sign In to the Console</code> .</p>
<p>If you’ve never set up an AWS account before, click <code>Create a New AWS account</code> and follow the instructions to create an account. Note that even if you’ve got an Amazon account for ordering stuff online and watching movies, an AWS account is separate.</p>
<p>#TODO: Add link to cloud chapter</p>
<p>Once you’ve logged in, you’ll be confronted by the AWS console. There are a ton of things here, and it’s rather overwhelming. There’s a chapter on the business model behind this, so skip ahead if you want, or spend a minute poking around before continuing.</p>
</div>
<div id="stand-up-an-instance" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.5.2</span> Stand up an instance</h3>
<p>In the next few paragraphs, I’m going to give you instructions to quickly get a server up – with basically no explanation. If you read this whole book, you’ll understand all of this, the alternatives you could take, and the reasons I’m going to strongly recommend you take this server back offline in just a few minutes.</p>
<p>For now, click on the EC2 service (it’s under <code>Launch a virtual machine</code> or <code>Compute</code> depending on where you landed). Scroll down the launch instance button. Here are all the different Quick Start Amazon Machine Images (AMIs). Find and click <code>Ubuntu Server 20.04 LTS</code> – it’ll be one of the first handful.</p>
<p>Now you’ll be seeing the instance size chooser. It should have auto-selected a server with the label <code>Free tier eligible</code>. Just stick with this for now.</p>
<p>Scroll down and click <code>Review and Launch</code>, and <code>Launch</code> on the next page.</p>
<p>When you click Launch, you’ll be asked to use a key pair. Assuming you don’t have an existing keypair, select <code>Create a new key pair</code>, name it <code>my_test_key</code>, and click <code>Download</code>.</p>
<p>Keep track of the <code>my_test_key.pem</code> file your computer downloads.</p>
<p>Click <code>Launch Instances</code>. AWS is now creating a virtual server <em>just for you</em>. If you click <code>View Instances</code> in the lower right, you’ll see your instance. When the instance state switches to <code>Running</code>, it’s up and running!</p>
</div>
<div id="ssh-into-the-server" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.5.3</span> SSH into the server</h3>
<p>The <code>.pem</code> key you downloaded is the skeleton key to your server. If you were setting up a real server, you’d need to be extremely careful with this key, as it allows anyone who has it unrestricted access to the server. For the same reason, it’s also great for playing around quickly with a server.</p>
<p>Before we can use it to open the server, we’ll need to make a quick change to the permissions on the key. More details on what that means in the [] chapter. #TODO: which chapter?</p>
<p>To take the next steps, you’ll need to at least be able to open your computer’s terminal and copy/paste some commands below. If that’s new to you, feel free to check out the <a href="command-line.html#command-line">chapter on using the command line</a>.</p>
<p>If you’re on a Mac or Linux system, you’ll do the following:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb5"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb5-1"><a href="computers-and-servers.html#cb5-1"></a>$ <span class="bu">cd</span> ~/Downloads <span class="co">#or whatever directory the key is in</span></span>
<span id="cb5-2"><a href="computers-and-servers.html#cb5-2"></a>$ <span class="fu">chmod</span> 600 my_test_key.pem</span></code></pre></div>
<p>#TODO: Windows?</p>
<p>To access your server, click on the <code>Instance ID</code> link for your server, and copy the <code>Public IPv4 DNS</code>, which will start with <code>ec2-</code> and end with <code>amazonaws.com</code>.</p>
<p>In your terminal type the following</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb6"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb6-1"><a href="computers-and-servers.html#cb6-1"></a>$ <span class="fu">ssh</span> -i my_test_key.pem ubuntu@<span class="op">&lt;</span>Public IPv4 DNS you copied<span class="op">&gt;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Type <code>yes</code> when prompted, and you’re now logged in to your server!</p>
</div>
<div id="doing-a-thing" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.5.4</span> Doing A Thing</h3>
<p>Before we log off and kill this server, let’s do one little thing.</p>
<p>We’re going to stand up Nginx, which is a common webserver, and serve a little webpage to ourselves.</p>
<p>Let’s start by installing Nginx, copy and paste the command below.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb7"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb7-1"><a href="computers-and-servers.html#cb7-1"></a>$ <span class="fu">sudo</span> apt update</span>
<span id="cb7-2"><a href="computers-and-servers.html#cb7-2"></a>$ <span class="fu">sudo</span> apt-get install nginx -y</span></code></pre></div>
<p>By default, our EC2 instance only allows SSH traffic. We need to open up HTTP traffic. Go back to your instance in the AWS console and scroll down to the Security tab. Click the blue link under <code>Security Groups</code>, which will start with <code>sg-</code> and include <code>launch-wizard-</code> in parentheses.</p>
<p>Click <code>Edit inbound rules</code> , then <code>Add rule</code>. Under <code>Type</code>, scroll down and select <code>HTTP</code>, and under <code>Source Type</code>, select <code>Anywhere-IPv4</code>. Scroll down and click <code>Save rules</code>.</p>
<p>Go back to your instance page and copy the <code>Public IPv4 DNS</code> again. Paste this into your browser’s navigation bar, and add <code>http://</code> right before. When you navigate to the page, you’ll see the default Nginx home page.</p>
<p>Let’s make a quick change to the page, just for fun.</p>
<p>Back in your terminal that’s still SSH-ed into the instance, navigate to where that page is located:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb8"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb8-1"><a href="computers-and-servers.html#cb8-1"></a>$ <span class="bu">cd</span> /var/www/html</span></code></pre></div>
<p>You can edit the page by typing</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb9"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb9-1"><a href="computers-and-servers.html#cb9-1"></a>$ <span class="fu">sudo</span> vi index.nginx-debian.html</span></code></pre></div>
<p>If you don’t recall how to use <code>vi</code>, check out the <a href="">command line</a> tutorial, but for now, you can enter edit mode by pressing <code>i</code>, navigating around with the arrow keys, and typing.</p>
<p>Edit something – say change this line</p>
<pre><code>&lt;h1&gt;Welcome to nginx!&lt;/h1 &gt;</code></pre>
<p>to something a little more personalized.</p>
<p>When you’re done, hit <code>esc</code> followed by <code>:wq</code>.</p>
<p>Now, when you re-load the page in your browser, you should be able to see your changes reflected there.</p>
</div>
<div id="burn-it-all-down" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.5.5</span> Burn it all down</h3>
<p>One of the best things about cloud infrastructure is that it can go away as easily as it came up. We made a number of choices here that are fine for ephemeral infrastructure for playing around. But this server should not be used for anything real.</p>
<p>When you’ve had your fill of playing, let’s take the server down.</p>
<p>Go back to the EC2 page for your server. Under the <code>Instance State</code> drop down in the upper right, choose <code>Terminate Instance</code>. If you go to the <code>Instances</code> page, it’ll take just a minute for the instance to go away.</p>

<li><p>You try to load a big csv file into pandas in Python. It churns for a while and then crashes.</p></li>
<li><p>You go to build a new ML model on your data. You’d like to re-train the model once a day, but it turns out training this model takes 26 hours on your laptop.</p></li>
<li><p>You design an visualization <code>Matplotlib</code> , and create a whole bunch in a loop/</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Try standing up a new server and installing R and RStudio Server Open Source, or Python and JupyterHub.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Hint 1: Remember that your instance only allows traffic to SSH in on port <code>22</code> by default. You access RStudio on port <code>8787</code> by default and JupyterHub on port <code>8000</code>. You control what ports are open via the Security Group.</p></li>
<li><p>Hint 2: You’ll need to create a user on the server. The <code>adduser</code> command is your friend.</p></li>
