<h1><span class="header-section-number">Chapter 3</span> Computers and Servers</h1>
<p>Data Science is fundamentally a computational practice. While being a great data scientist doesn’t rely on any deep understanding of computational theory, a mental model of what your computer is doing can be really helpful.</p>
<p>Moreover, as you start putting work into production more, your conversations will be less about the goodness-of-fit of models – and more about how to make sure those models can run reliably.</p>
<p>In this chapter, you’ll learn about the important components inside your computer for data science work and the similarities and differences it has with a server-based environment. If you’re near your computer and ready to try it out, you’ll have stood up a server of your very own by the end of the chapter.</p>
<div id="background-on-what-a-computer-is" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.1</span> Background on what a computer is</h2>
<p>As the saying goes, all models are wrong, but some are useful. I’ve found a helpful model is to think of your computer as a cookie-topping factory, with three important components.</p>
<p>#TODO: Is this analogy helpful?</p>
<p>If you’re into pedantic nitpicking, you’re going to love picking this chapter apart, as I grossly oversimplify how computers work. On the other hand, this basic mental model has served me well across hundreds of interactions with data scientists and IT/DevOps professionals.</p>
<p><img src="images/200-servers/data_science_machine.jpeg" width="526" /></p>
<p>In my mental model, the three components of a computer are <em>compute</em>, <em>storage</em>, and <em>memory</em>. Let’s get into all three below.</p>
<div id="input-output" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.1.1</span> Input + Output</h3>
<p>I don’t think of <strong>Input and Output</strong> as a part of the computer – but information has to get in and out somehow. For the computer on your desk, you might provide input with your keyboard and mouse, or your microphone or camera. Output might come via your monitor or speakers. For servers, the input and output are usually just pure information, and we’ll get more into that below.</p>
<p>An important component of your mental model is the homogenization of input and output. While you might interpret it as the word <em>umbrella</em> or Mario running left, a bit of R code or a machine learning model – it’s all the same to your computer. So you can think of your computer as the thing operating on the homogenized data, with some translation layers back and forth into something you can interpret.</p>
</div>
<div id="compute-cpu-gpu" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.1.2</span> Compute (CPU + GPU)</h3>
<p>When you get right down to it, all a computer does is add some numbers. Once input and output has been homogenized, every input is a request to add some numbers, and every output is the result of an addition.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Your computer is very good at adding very, very fast.</p>
<p>The <strong>compute</strong> is where the actual addition gets done. Within the compute, there are many individual <em>cores</em>, which can do one addition at a time. I think of each core as a single assembly line. you can consider as a single assembly line. Each core can do one addition at a time.</p>
<p>All computers do much of their computation inside the the central processing unit (CPU) – the main addition factory. These days, most consumer-grade laptops have between 4 and 16 pretty fast cores, and may have additional capabilities that effectively doubles that number. So your CPU can do somewhere between 4 and 32 simultaneous addition problems.</p>
<p>The reason that compute isn’t synonymous with CPU is that some computers offload some of their compute to a graphical processing unit (GPU). A GPU is a separate entity from the CPU that is used for certain tasks like editing photo or videos, rendering video game graphics, some kinds of machine learning, and (yes) Bitcoin mining.</p>
<p>The GPU is part of your computer’s compute as well, but it’s differently specialized. Where the CPU has a few relatively fast cores, the GPU takes the opposite approach, with many weaker cores. Where a consumer-grade CPU has 4-16 cores, mid-range GPUs have 700-4,000.</p>
<p>It turns out that for the kinds of tasks a GPU specializes in, the overwhelming parallelism of a GPU is more important than the speed of any individual core, and GPU computation can be dramatically quicker relative to CPU computation.</p>
<p>While I’d encourage you to think of your CPU and GPU combined in one big adding factory, it’s worth keeping in mind that using a CPU is completely automatic. On the other hand, many computers don’t include dedicated GPUs, and using GPUs for machine learning can be a hassle – though it’s getting easier all the time.</p>
</div>
<div id="memory-ram" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.1.3</span> Memory (RAM)</h3>
<p>When a cookie-topping factory starts working in the morning, they take a bunch of stuff out of cold storage, warm it up to room temperature, and get it ready for the day. At the end of the day, when they close down, they clean up and put any leftovers back into the freezer for another time.</p>
<p>In your computer, that working inventory is the RAM (Random Access Memory).</p>
<p>RAM is where your computer stores things it’s actively using, or thinks it might need again soon. RAM is very fast to access, but is only temporary. When your computer turns off, the RAM gets wiped.</p>
<p>Modern consumer-grade laptops come with somewhere between 4 and 16 Gb of memory, though not all of that can be devoted to your datasets.</p>
<p>These days, you probably fully turn off your computer rarely, and your computer is pretty smart about saving the contents of your RAM into long-term storage when you turn off your computer, so you probably don’t experience much of a disruption.</p>
</div>
<div id="storage-hard-drivedisk" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.1.4</span> Storage (Hard Drive/Disk)</h3>
<p>Your computer’s storage is like a freezer. It keeps things permanently, whether the factory is operating or not. The tradeoff is that things there are cold, and take some time to warm up before they can be used.</p>
<aside>
<p>You probably know this, but storage is measured in bytes. These days, most consumer hard drives are between 1/2 to a few terrabytes (trillion bytes). Some enterprise data stores run on the scales of thousands of terrabytes (pettabytes) or even thousands of pettabytes (yottabytes).</p>
</aside>
<p>A few years ago, all hard drives were (HDDs), and were basically the same. HDDs have a bunch of magnetic disks that spin very fast (5,400 and 7,200 RPM are common speeds). A magnetized read/write head move among the disks and save and read your data.</p>
<p>In the last few years, solid-state drives (SSDs) have been taking over. SSDs, which are collections of flash memory chips are much faster than HDDs – up to 15x or so. They also can take a wider variety of shapes and sizes, and are more reliable and durable because they have no moving parts. The main drawback is that you get much less storage for the price.</p>
<p>Many consumer laptops have only an SSD at this point. Some desktops and high-end laptops combine a smaller SSD with a larger HDD.</p>
<p>In your addition factory, the important thing to understand about storage is that it’s cold storage. Everything has to move out of permanent storage before it can be used, which is a relatively slow operation, even on an SSD.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="choosing-the-right-data-science-machine" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.2</span> Choosing the right data science machine</h2>
<p>Now that you understand how compute, storage, and memory work together to execute your R or Python code, let’s dig into the attributes you might care about when choosing a data science machine.</p>
<p>The good news is that there are only three attributes (plus two) to really care about for your data science machine.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Data scientists always want more RAM.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Most other issues with your machine are pretty quickly fixable or will just result in operations being somewhat slower than you’d ideally want. But if you don’t have enough RAM, your R or Python session will just crash, and you won’t be able to do your analysis.</p>
<aside>
<p>You can get around the in-memory limitation by using a <a href="choosing-and-using-a-data-architecture.html#database">database</a> or libraries that facilitate on-disk operations like Apache Arrow. Depending on the size of your data and how computationally intensive your work is, this can be a real limitation on where you can do your work.</p>
</aside>
<p>It’s easy to say that you’ll always want more RAM, but a rough rule of thumb for whether you’ve got enough is the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Amount of RAM = max amount of data * 3</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Because you’ll often be doing some sort of transformation that results in invisible data copies and your computer can’t devote all of its memory, you’ll want to leave plenty of room over your actual data size. I’ve never run into problems with a scaling factor of 3, but this is definitely only a rough rule-of-thumb.</p>
<p>The other two attributes relate to your compute - the <strong>number of cores</strong> and <strong>single-core speed</strong>.</p>
<p>As you’ve probably heard, <strong>R and Python are single-threaded</strong>. This means that, unless you’re using special libraries for parallel processing, R and Python will just use a single core, which means that single core speed matters more than the number of cores, and fewer, faster cores are usually preferable to many slower ones.</p>
<p>The exception being certain types of machine learning operations, especially training neural networks, which can be drastically sped up by GPU processing. However, you probably don’t have a machine that’s <em>just</em> for training neural networks, so combining and few fast cores in your CPU with many weaker cores in the GPU is a great strategy.</p>
<p>Determining the number of cores in your computer is straightforward – both Windows and Mac have <em>About this machine</em> information where you can see the number.</p>
<p>The basic measure of single-core speed is its “clock speed” in hertz (hz) – operations per second. Modern consumer-grade cores run on the order of 2-5 gigahertz (GHz): 2-5 billion operations per second.</p>
<aside>
<p>A few decades ago, there was a steady march in increases in clock speed – increasing by approximately 10x during the 90s, by 2-3x in the 2000s, and somewhere between not at all and 1.5x in the 2010s. Computers have gotten much faster through this entire time, but mostly from sources other than boosts in single-core clock speeds.</p>
<p>For example, in 2020, Apple released a series of Macs with its new M1 chip. Real-world performance of the M1 chip was dramatically better than earlier models, despite modest improvements in clock speeds.</p>
</aside>
<p>When you’re thinking about how to choose a CPU, fewer, faster cores are preferable to lots of cores. If you’re buying a laptop or desktop, you probably don’t need to think much about this, but if you’re configuring a server, this is often a choice you’re able to make quite directly.</p>
<p>The other two configuration options you should consider – but only briefly - are whether you need a GPU and how much storage to get. You probably want a GPU if you’re doing substantial machine learning that can be improved by GPU-backed operations – this is especially true for highly parallel machine learning problems like training a neural network or tree-based models.</p>
<p>As for storage – get a lot – but don’t think about it too hard, because it’s cheap. Both a 1TB SSD and a 4TB HDD are around $100. It’s almost always cheaper to just get more storage relative to trying to figure out how to move things around.</p>
<aside>
<p>One litmus test of an IT organization that is well-equipped to support data science is whether they understand this. Smart organizations know that just getting more storage is easily worth the cost in terms of the time of admins and data scientists.</p>

</div>
<div id="how-is-a-server-different" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.3</span> How is a server different?</h2>
<p>You now have a pretty keen understanding of how a computer works. So what is a server?</p>
<p>Before I was intimately acquainted with servers, they seemed mystical – incredibly powerful, probably perched among the clouds on a misty mountainside. Turns out the reality is far more prosaic and closer to stripmall than shaolin temple.</p>
<p>You already understand how a server works. It’s as simple as taking the input streams you’ve conceptualized as coming from a keyboard, mouse, and microphone and thinking of them instead as requests from other computers, and taking the output going directly to your desktop and thinking of them as responses to those requests.</p>
<p><img src="images/200-servers/desktop_v_server.jpeg" width="424" /></p>
<p>While those input and output streams may change, what goes on in between is exactly the same. It’s all just a bunch of addition in compute, with short term memory, and long-term storage.</p>
<aside>
<p>That’s not to say the input and output format don’t matter. We’ll spend a lot of this book reviewing how to make sure servers can get the input they need, can filter out bad input, and return output to the right place. It’s just that your mental model of what the server does needn’t incorporate this element.</p>
</aside>
<p>In terms of where these machines live, the most common answer is really boring-looking office parks. Most servers people use are rented from one of the big cloud providers (more on that in the next chapter).</p>
<p>In the remainder of this book, you’ll get really comfortable with servers. By the time you’re done, you should have a pretty thorough understanding of what servers are, how to get and interact with one, and how to make sure the way you use them is secure.</p>
<p>You already interact with servers constantly when you do everyday tasks like pull up something on your phone, navigate to a website, or use a credit card. Normally, you’re interacting with the publicly-exposed application layer of a server. Throughout the rest of this book, we’ll get comfortable interacting with servers you rent or own as an administrator.</p>
<p>The biggest difference between interacting with your desktop and interacting with a server is that you’ll do so over the command line, rather than clicking with a keyboard.</p>
<div id="most-servers-run-linux" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.3.1</span> Most servers run Linux</h3>
<p>When you want to do something administrative on your laptop – say install a new program, or change screen resolutions – you probably just open a window on your machine. Those are features of your computer’s operating system – the most common being Mac OS or Windows.</p>
<p>A computer’s operating system forms the basic interface between the computer’s hardware and the software you want to run to actually do things. It includes the software for how the computer boots up, the background services (audio, printing, etc), and the desktop you interact with when switching from one application to another.</p>
<p>Most people think exclusively of Mac OS or Windows when thinking of operating systems, as they rule the desktop computing world. But those computers are vastly outnumbered by the number and variety of servers and other computing platforms that run <em>Linux</em>.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>Along with most of the world’s servers, almost all of the world’s embedded computers – in ATMs, cars and planes, TVs, and most other gadgets and gizmos – run on Linux. If you have an Android phone or a Chromebook – that’s Linux. Basically all of the world’s supercomputers use Linux.</p>
<p>There are many different distributions (usually called “distros”) of Linux. For day-to-day enterprise server use, the most common of these are Ubuntu, CentOS, Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), SUSE Enterprise Linux.</p>
<p>Because of its ubiquity in the server world, we’ll be using Linux servers and distributions for the rest of this book.</p>

<div id="moving-data-science-to-a-server" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.4</span> Moving Data Science to A Server</h2>
<p>Many organizations run their data science workloads on a server, as opposed to on each employee’s laptop. In recent years, as data science has become more important, this has been happening more and more commonly. Depending on your organization, the centralization of data science operations can make your life way easier – or it can be kinda a bummer.</p>
<div id="data-scientist-led-server-migration" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.4.1</span> Data Scientist-led server migration</h3>
<p>Often, migrations to a server are instigated by the data scientists themselves – usually because they’ve run out of horsepower on their laptops. These migrations tend to be partial, temporary, and often kinda slapdash.</p>
<p>They’re configured for the purposes of a single project, and are managed by the data scientists themselves.</p>
<p>If you, or one of your teammates, enjoys and is good as SysAdmin work, this can be a great situation! You get the hardware you need for your project quickly and with minimal interference.</p>
<p>On the other hand, most data scientists don’t really want to be SysAdmins, and these systems are often fragile, isolated from other corporate systems, and potentially susceptible to security vulnerabilities.</p>
</div>
<div id="sysadmin-led-server-migration" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.4.2</span> SysAdmin-led server migration</h3>
<p>Many other organizations are moving to servers as well, but led by the IT group. For many IT groups, it’s way easier to maintain a centralized server environment, as opposed to helping each data scientist maintain their own environment on their laptop.</p>
<p>Having just one platform makes it much easier to give shared access to more powerful computing platforms, to data sources that require some configuration, and to R and Python packages that wrap around system libraries and can be a pain to configure (looking at you, <code>rJava</code>).</p>
<p>This can be a great situation for data scientists! If the platform is well-configured and scoped, you can get instant access through their web browser to more compute resources, and don’t have to worry about maintaining local installations of data science tools like R, Python, RStudio, and Jupyter, and you don’t need to worry about how to connect to important data sources – those things are just available for use.</p>
<p>But this can also be a bad experience. Long wait times for hardware or software updates, overly restrictive policies – especially around package management – and misunderstandings of what data scientists are trying to do on the platforms can lead to servers going largely unused.</p>
<p>So much of whether the server-based experience is good or not depends on the relationship between the data science and IT/Admin group. In organizations where these groups work together smoothly, this can be a huge win for everyone involved. However, there are some organizations where IT/Admins are so concerned with stability and security that they make it impossible to do data science, and the data scientists spend all their time playing cat-and-mouse games to try to get work done behind IT/Admin’s backs.</p>
<p>If you work at such a place, it’s frankly hard to get much done on the server. It’s probably worth investing some time into improving your relationship with your favorite person on the IT/Admin team. Hopefully, this book will help you understand a little of what’s on the minds of people in the IT group, and a sense of how to talk to them better.</p>

<div id="getting-a-server-of-your-own" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.5</span> Getting a server of your own</h2>
<p>Let’s completely switch gears and get practical.</p>
<p>Until now, this chapter has been entirely background. If you read it, hopefully you learned a little about a computer works, how your computer is mostly like, but a little unlike a server, and why you might be doing data science on a server.</p>
<p>If you’re reading this book, you probably want a deeper understanding of how using and maintaining a server actually works. In the last section of this chapter, we’ll walk through how you can get a server of your very own.</p>
<p>In contrast to the computer sitting on your desk, you’ll have to access it over the internet and you’ll use a specialized access protocol called <a href="ssh.html#ssh">SSH</a>. Those topics are important enough that there are standalone chapters on them. For now, we’re going to gloss entirely over the how and why and just get you to running a server. If you follow along from this point, it’ll probably take you 10-15 minutes to be running a server of your own.</p>
<p>We’re going to be standing up a server on Amazon Web Services (AWS). In particular, we’ll be standing up a server in their <em>free tier</em> – so there will be no cost involved as long as you haven’t used up all your AWS free tier credits before now.</p>
<div id="login-to-the-aws-console" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.5.1</span> Login to the AWS Console</h3>
<p>We’re going to start by logging into AWS. If you’ve done this before, just go ahead and log in.</p>
<p>If not, go to aws.amazon.com and click <code>Sign In to the Console</code> .</p>
<p>If you’ve never set up an AWS account before, click <code>Create a New AWS account</code> and follow the instructions to create an account. Note that even if you’ve got an Amazon account for ordering stuff online and watching movies, an AWS account is separate.</p>
<p>#TODO: Add link to cloud chapter</p>
<p>Once you’ve logged in, you’ll be confronted by the AWS console. There are a ton of things here, and it’s rather overwhelming. There’s a chapter on the business model behind this, so skip ahead if you want, or spend a minute poking around before continuing.</p>
</div>
<div id="stand-up-an-instance" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.5.2</span> Stand up an instance</h3>
<p>In the next few paragraphs, I’m going to give you instructions to quickly get a server up – with basically no explanation. If you read this whole book, you’ll understand all of this, the alternatives you could take, and the reasons I’m going to strongly recommend you take this server back offline in just a few minutes.</p>
<p>For now, click on the EC2 service (it’s under <code>Launch a virtual machine</code> or <code>Compute</code> depending on where you landed). Scroll down the launch instance button. Here are all the different Quick Start Amazon Machine Images (AMIs). Find and click <code>Ubuntu Server 20.04 LTS</code> – it’ll be one of the first handful.</p>
<p>Now you’ll be seeing the instance size chooser. It should have auto-selected a server with the label <code>Free tier eligible</code>. Just stick with this for now.</p>
<p>Scroll down and click <code>Review and Launch</code>, and <code>Launch</code> on the next page.</p>
<p>When you click Launch, you’ll be asked to use a key pair. Assuming you don’t have an existing keypair, select <code>Create a new key pair</code>, name it <code>my_test_key</code>, and click <code>Download</code>.</p>
<p>Keep track of the <code>my_test_key.pem</code> file your computer downloads.</p>
<p>Click <code>Launch Instances</code>. AWS is now creating a virtual server <em>just for you</em>. If you click <code>View Instances</code> in the lower right, you’ll see your instance. When the instance state switches to <code>Running</code>, it’s up and running!</p>
</div>
<div id="ssh-into-the-server" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.5.3</span> SSH into the server</h3>
<p>The <code>.pem</code> key you downloaded is the skeleton key to your server. If you were setting up a real server, you’d need to be extremely careful with this key, as it allows anyone who has it unrestricted access to the server. For the same reason, it’s also great for playing around quickly with a server.</p>
<p>Before we can use it to open the server, we’ll need to make a quick change to the permissions on the key. More details on what that means in the [] chapter. #TODO: which chapter?</p>
<p>To take the next steps, you’ll need to at least be able to open your computer’s terminal and copy/paste some commands below. If that’s new to you, feel free to check out the <a href="command-line.html#command-line">chapter on using the command line</a>.</p>
<p>If you’re on a Mac or Linux system, you’ll do the following:</p>

<p>#TODO: Windows?</p>
<p>To access your server, click on the <code>Instance ID</code> link for your server, and copy the <code>Public IPv4 DNS</code>, which will start with <code>ec2-</code> and end with <code>amazonaws.com</code>.</p>
<p>In your terminal type the following</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb4"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb4-1"><a href="computers-and-servers.html#cb4-1"></a>$ <span class="fu">ssh</span> -i my_test_key.pem ubuntu@<span class="op">&lt;</span>Public IPv4 DNS you copied<span class="op">&gt;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Type <code>yes</code> when prompted, and you’re now logged in to your server!</p>
</div>
<div id="doing-a-thing" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.5.4</span> Doing A Thing</h3>
<p>Before we log off and kill this server, let’s do one little thing.</p>
<p>We’re going to stand up Nginx, which is a common webserver, and serve a little webpage to ourselves.</p>
<p>Let’s start by installing Nginx, copy and paste the command below.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb5"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb5-1"><a href="computers-and-servers.html#cb5-1"></a>$ <span class="fu">sudo</span> apt update</span>

<p>By default, our EC2 instance only allows SSH traffic. We need to open up HTTP traffic. Go back to your instance in the AWS console and scroll down to the Security tab. Click the blue link under <code>Security Groups</code>, which will start with <code>sg-</code> and include <code>launch-wizard-</code> in parentheses.</p>
<p>Click <code>Edit inbound rules</code> , then <code>Add rule</code>. Under <code>Type</code>, scroll down and select <code>HTTP</code>, and under <code>Source Type</code>, select <code>Anywhere-IPv4</code>. Scroll down and click <code>Save rules</code>.</p>
<p>Go back to your instance page and copy the <code>Public IPv4 DNS</code> again. Paste this into your browser’s navigation bar, and add <code>http://</code> right before. When you navigate to the page, you’ll see the default Nginx home page.</p>
<p>Let’s make a quick change to the page, just for fun.</p>
<p>Back in your terminal that’s still SSH-ed into the instance, navigate to where that page is located:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb6"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb6-1"><a href="computers-and-servers.html#cb6-1"></a>$ <span class="bu">cd</span> /var/www/html</span></code></pre></div>
<p>You can edit the page by typing</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb7"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb7-1"><a href="computers-and-servers.html#cb7-1"></a>$ <span class="fu">sudo</span> vi index.nginx-debian.html</span></code></pre></div>
<p>If you don’t recall how to use <code>vi</code>, check out the <a href="">command line</a> tutorial, but for now, you can enter edit mode by pressing <code>i</code>, navigating around with the arrow keys, and typing.</p>
<p>Edit something – say change this line</p>
<pre><code>&lt;h1&gt;Welcome to nginx!&lt;/h1 &gt;</code></pre>
<p>to something a little more personalized.</p>
<p>When you’re done, hit <code>esc</code> followed by <code>:wq</code>.</p>
<p>Now, when you re-load the page in your browser, you should be able to see your changes reflected there.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.5.5</span> Burn it all down</h3>
<p>One of the best things about cloud infrastructure is that it can go away as easily as it came up. We made a number of choices here that are fine for ephemeral infrastructure for playing around. But this server should not be used for anything real.</p>
<p>When you’ve had your fill of playing, let’s take the server down.</p>
<p>Go back to the EC2 page for your server. Under the <code>Instance State</code> drop down in the upper right, choose <code>Terminate Instance</code>. If you go to the <code>Instances</code> page, it’ll take just a minute for the instance to go away.</p>

<li><p>Think about the scenarios below – which part of your computer would you want to upgrade to solve the problem?</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>You try to load a big csv file into pandas in Python. It churns for a while and then crashes.</p></li>
<li><p>You go to build a new ML model on your data. You’d like to re-train the model once a day, but it turns out training this model takes 26 hours on your laptop.</p></li>
<li><p>You design an visualization <code>Matplotlib</code> , and create a whole bunch in a loop/</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Try standing up a new server and installing R and RStudio Server Open Source, or Python and JupyterHub.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Hint 1: Remember that your instance only allows traffic to SSH in on port <code>22</code> by default. You access RStudio on port <code>8787</code> by default and JupyterHub on port <code>8000</code>. You control what ports are open via the Security Group.</p></li>
<li><p>Hint 2: You’ll need to create a user on the server. The <code>adduser</code> command is your friend.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>#TODO: test out JupyterHub</p></li>
